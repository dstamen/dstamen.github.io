I came across a problem I thought i would document and share.
While trying to setup my Platform Service Controllers for HA. I was having issues sshing into the appliance. I kept on getting errors, that the packet sizes were too big or just authentication would fail.</description></item><item><title>Enable SSH on vSphere Management Assistant 5.0</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2014/05/01/enable-ssh-on-vma-5-0/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2014/05/01/enable-ssh-on-vma-5-0/</guid><description>While continuing to build out my lab for VCAP-DCA today I had to deploy the vMA (vSphere Management Assistant).

Logon to vMA via a Console Session Run &amp;lsquo;sudo vi /etc/hosts.allow&amp;rsquo; Scroll to the very bottom and type i to insert content into the file.</description></item></channel></rss>
