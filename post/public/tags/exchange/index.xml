Unfortunately i was unable to find any commands so thanks to MS Support I was able to find a way to identify these. You would think it would be under Get-DistributionGroup but it is actually under Get-MSolGroup. After connecting via remote powershell you can run the below command to see all that are not synced.</description></item><item><title>Office 365/Exchange EAC Pop Ups not working with Chrome 37</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2014/10/16/office-365exchange-eac-pop-ups-not-working-with-chrome-37/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2014/10/16/office-365exchange-eac-pop-ups-not-working-with-chrome-37/</guid><description>Chrome depreciated one of the features that allowed these popups to work, here is a temporary workaround to get it working.
Download the Chrome Policy Plugin here
Open the zip file you just downloaded and locate the .ADM file that best matches your system: Extract the .ADM file to any folder on your hard drive Go to Start &amp;gt; Run, and run gpedit.msc Right-click Local Computer Policy &amp;gt; Computer Configuration &amp;gt; Administrative Templates, and select Add/Remove Templates: Add the adm template that you saved to disk earlier: You should now see the template underneath a Google &amp;gt; Google Chrome section within Administrative Templates Depending on which operating system you have, it might be under a Classic Administrative Templates (ADM) folder: Click on Google Chrome in the left-hand pane and then double-click on the item called Enable deprecated web platform features in the list within the right-hand pane: NOTE: It helps to sort the table in the right-hand pane by the Setting column in order to find the Enable deprecated web platform features item more easily.</description></item><item><title>Blocking Attachments With Executable Content</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2014/05/01/blocking-attachments-with-executable-content/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2014/05/01/blocking-attachments-with-executable-content/</guid><description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know whats going on in the past few weeks but the sheer amount of zeroday exploits via email have risen. To protect yourselves against this I would recommend setting up a transport rule to drop or reject any email with executable content. This can be done for Exchange 2013 or Office365 (Exchange Online).
Login to Exchange Admin Center using administrative credentials On the left pane select &amp;ldquo;Mail flow&amp;rdquo; On the top pane select &amp;quot; Rules&amp;rdquo; Click on the &amp;ldquo;+&amp;rdquo; sign and select create a new rule Give a name to the rule and select &amp;ldquo;more options&amp;rdquo; at the bottom of the page.</description></item></channel></rss>
