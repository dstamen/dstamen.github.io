I am honored to have been accepted once again as a Cisco Champion for 2016!

I had a bit of a gap in blog posts this past year due to a job change. However, look forward to more posts on Cisco UCS and maybe even some Cisco ACI.

I am a member of the Cisco Champions Program. Cisco Champions are passionate about Cisco and enjoy sharing our knowledge, expertise, and thoughts across the social web and with Cisco. I am not a representative of Cisco. My views as a Cisco Champion are my own.
