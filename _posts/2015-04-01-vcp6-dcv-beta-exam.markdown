VMware has announced [https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/plan.cfm?plan=64178&ui=www_cert](https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/plan.cfm?plan=64178&ui=www_cert) the availability of the VCP6-DCV beta exams. The beta exam includes 3 seperate exams. If you are currently an active VCP you can either take the VCP6-DCV or VCP6-DCV Delta exam, and if you are currently not certified you are required to take the vSphere 6 Foundations and VCP6-DCV to obtain the certification.

[vSphere 6 Foundations](https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/plan.cfm?plan=64179&ui=www_cert) : Exam code: 2V0-620

[VCP6-DCV](https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/plan.cfm?plan=64180&ui=www_cert) : Exam Code: 2V0-621

[VCP6-DCV Delta](https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/plan.cfm?plan=64181&ui=www_cert) : Exam Code: 2V0-621D

The good news is that the beta exams cost $50, definately better than the $225 price the exams will increase to once they go GA. One thing to note about Beta exams is you will not immediately recieve a score. Full details about the beta exams can be found here [https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/plan.cfm?plan=63957&ui=www_cert](https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/plan.cfm?plan=63957&ui=www_cert) .

If you look at the VCP6-DCV certification page, you will notice one thing missing. There is no longer a blueprint posted, but a web based version of it. I have taken the time and broken it out into PDF form which you can find attached to this blogpost, as I move through studying, I will be updating it with more content so please stay tuned for an updated version with study content.
