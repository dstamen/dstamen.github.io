- Configure FC/iSCSI/FCoE LUNs as ESXi boot devices
- Create an NFS share for use with vSphere
- Enable/Configure/Disable vCenter Server storage filters
- Configure/Edit hardware/dependent hardware initiators
- Enable/Disable software iSCSI initiator
- Configure/Edit software iSCSI initiator settings
- Configure iSCSI port binding
- Enable/Configure/Disable iSCSI CHAP
- Determine use cases for fiber channel zoning
- Compare and contrast array thin provisioning and virtual disk thin provisioning

#### Objective 3.2: Configure Software-defined Storage
- Discover new storage LUNs
- Configure FC/iSCSI/FCoE LUNs as ESXi boot devices
- Create an NFS share for use with vSphere
- Enable/Configure/Disable vCenter Server storage filters
- Configure/Edit hardware/dependent hardware initiators
- Enable/Disable software iSCSI initiator
- Configure/Edit software iSCSI initiator settings
- Configure iSCSI port binding
- Enable/Configure/Disable iSCSI CHAP
- Determine use cases for fiber channel zoning
- Compare and contrast array thin provisioning and virtual disk thin provisioning

#### Objective 3.3: Configure vSphere Storage Multi-pathing and Failover
- Explain common multi-pathing components
- Differentiate APD and PDL states
- Given a scenario, compare and contrast Active Optimized vs. Active non-Optimized port group states
- Explain features of Pluggable Storage Architecture (PSA)
- Understand the effects of a given claim rule on multipathing and failover
vExplain the function of claim rule elements:
  - Vendor
  - Model
  - Device ID
  - SATP
  - PSP
- Change the Path Selection Policy using the UI
- Determine required claim rule elements to change the default PSP
- Determine the effect of changing PSP on Multipathing and failover
- Determine the effects of changing SATP on relevant device behavior
- Configure/Manage Storage Load Balancing
- Differentiate available Storage Load Balancing options
- Differentiate available Storage Multi-pathing Policies
- Configure Storage Policies
- Locate failover events in the UI

#### Objective 3.4: Perform Advanced VMFS and NFS Configurations and Upgrades
- Describe VAAI primitives for block devices and NAS
- Differentiate VMware file system technologies
- Upgrade VMFS3 to VMFS5
- Compare functionality of newly created vs. upgraded VMFS5 datastores
- Differentiate Physical Mode RDMs and Virtual Mode RDMs
- Create a Virtual/Physical Mode RDM
- Differentiate NFS 3.x and 4.1 capabilities
- Compare and contrast VMFS and NFS datastore properties
- Configure Bus Sharing
- Configure Multi-writer locking
- Connect an NFS 4.1 datastore using Kerberos
- Create/Rename/Delete/Unmount VMFS datastores
- Mount/Unmount an NFS datastore
- Extend/Expand VMFS datastores
- Place a VMFS datastore in Maintenance Mode
- Select the Preferred Path/Disable a Path to a VMFS datastore
- Enable/Disable vStorage API for Array Integration (VAAI)
- Given a scenario, determine a proper use case for multiple VMFS/NFS datastores

#### Objective 3.5: Setup and Configure Storage I/O Control
- Describe the benefits of SIOC
- Enable and configure SIOC
- Configure/Manage SIOC
- Monitor SIOC
- Differentiate between SIOC and Dynamic Queue Depth - Throttling features
- Given a scenario, determine a proper use case for SIOC
- Compare and contrast the effects of I/O contention in environments with and without SIOC
