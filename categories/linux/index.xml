The answer may not be as easy as it seems.
I have been working on a Migration from PowerDNS using a MySQL DB. We have a custom solution which gets updated and gets pushed to Akamai. The problem is, this custom solution requires all the zones to be in bind format. Doing some research I found out there is no easy way to get these zones into a bind zone file.</description></item><item><title>Using Vagrant to Deploy an Ubuntu Server running KVM</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2015/10/12/using-vagrant-to-deploy-an-ubuntu-server-running-kvm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2015/10/12/using-vagrant-to-deploy-an-ubuntu-server-running-kvm/</guid><description>With all this talk about VMware vs KVM I figured that I would attempt to load a base install of KVM to see what it was all about.
Here is a quick vagrant runbook that will quickly get a 3 linux servers deployed and installed with KVM to play with.
There are 3 nodes..MGMT01,KVM01 and KVM02. I use MGMT01 VMM to manage KVM01 and KVM02.

I decided I would run it on Ubuntu Server using NGINX as the web platform.
Here is a quick vagrant runbook that will quickly get a linux server deployed and install NGINX to host your website.
