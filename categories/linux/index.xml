The answer may not be as easy as it seems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have been working on a Migration from PowerDNS using a MySQL DB. We have a custom solution which gets updated and gets pushed to Akamai. The problem is, this custom solution requires all the zones to be in bind format. Doing some research I found out there is no easy way to get these zones into a bind zone file. You could setup a secondary server and do zone transfers, but that wouldnt meet my requirements.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using Vagrant to Deploy an Ubuntu Server running KVM</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2015/10/12/using-vagrant-to-deploy-an-ubuntu-server-running-kvm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2015/10/12/using-vagrant-to-deploy-an-ubuntu-server-running-kvm/</guid><description>&lt;p>With all this talk about VMware vs KVM I figured that I would attempt to load a base install of KVM to see what it was all about.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is a quick vagrant runbook that will quickly get a 3 linux servers deployed and installed with KVM to play with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are 3 nodes..MGMT01,KVM01 and KVM02. I use MGMT01 VMM to manage KVM01 and KVM02.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The code can be found &lt;a href="https://github.com/dstamen/Vagrant/tree/master/ubuntukvm">here.&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using Vagrant to Deploy an Ubuntu Server running NGINX</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2015/09/08/using-vagrant-to-deploy-an-ubuntu-server-running-nginx/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2015/09/08/using-vagrant-to-deploy-an-ubuntu-server-running-nginx/</guid><description>&lt;p>So as I was getting around to trying to get a host platform setup for a Jekyll blog I was looking at an alternative to GitHub Pages. I decided I would run it on Ubuntu Server using NGINX as the web platform.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is a quick vagrant runbook that will quickly get a linux server deployed and install NGINX to host your website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The code can be found &lt;a href="https://github.com/dstamen/Vagrant/tree/master/jekyll-nginx">here.&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The bootstrap_linux_nginx.sh file runs the following commands to install NGINX. You can add commands to your file to automatically create your configuration and sites to publish automatically. By default this will just bring up the default nginx site.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
