&lt;p&gt;This is my eighth year as a vExpert (2013,2014,2015,2016,2017,2018,2019 and now 2020). It has been great to see the community grow and the amount of vExperts increase. Although I&amp;rsquo;m no longer employed at VMware I plan to still support the VMware community in any way I can. I plan to put more blogs on the personal blog this year and am excited to see folks at whichever industry events I am able to attend.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>vExpert 2018</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2018/03/12/vexpert-2018/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Mar 2018 06:41:02 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2018/03/12/vexpert-2018/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I am honored to have been selected as a VMware vExpert once again for 2018!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my sixth year as a vExpert (2013,2014,2015,2016,2017 and 2018). It has been great to see the community grow and the amount of vExperts increase. Now that my new role will have me travelling and presenting more, I look forward to meeting up with many new and existing vExperts this year!&lt;/p&gt;
