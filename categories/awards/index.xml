This is my eighth year as a vExpert (2013,2014,2015,2016,2017,2018,2019 and now 2020). It has been great to see the community grow and the amount of vExperts increase. Although I&amp;rsquo;m no longer employed at VMware I plan to still support the VMware community in any way I can. I plan to put more blogs on the personal blog this year and am excited to see folks at whichever industry events I am able to attend.</description></item><item><title>vExpert 2018</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2018/03/12/vexpert-2018/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Mar 2018 06:41:02 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2018/03/12/vexpert-2018/</guid><description>I am honored to have been selected as a VMware vExpert once again for 2018!
