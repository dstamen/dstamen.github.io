      <description>Life can always surprise you. For the past few years I have been chasing the dream like most to work for the “mothership” and recently the calling came.
This month, I will be joining the CPBU at VMware as a Technical Marketing Engineer focused on vSphere upgrades. I will be working alongside Adam Eckerle, Emad Younis, Kyle Ruddy, Mike Foley, Brian Graf, Nigel Hickey and more!
Nigel has it perfect when he titled his announcement “Oh the places you’ll go”.</description>
