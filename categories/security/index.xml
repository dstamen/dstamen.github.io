      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday August 14th, Intel Released their news on the latest vulnerability &lt;strong&gt;L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF) or ForeShadow&lt;/strong&gt;. In response to this VMware released vSphere patches to address the issues. Since then I have seen quite a few threads come up and thought i would address them from a patching perspective.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>So going though v7, v8 and v9 of the certificate guides I continued to have some issues getting the certificate to work and the steps never included ways to add subject alternative names. Upon further research I have identified a good step by step to replace the trend micro DSM certificate and include subject alternative names using a Microsoft certificate authority.
 Stop the “Trend Micro Deep Security Manager” service If not already created, create a folder on the root of C:\ called “certs” Go to C:\Program Files\Trend Micro\Deep Security Manager and create a new folder called “Backupkeystore” Copy .</description>
