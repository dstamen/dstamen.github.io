This time to configure Syslog. The script is pretty straightforward, but nice to have to easily set up Syslog across multiple UCS domains.

I tried to use the ACI-PowerTool for this task, however it doesnt seem to work with the newer code we are on. So I went back and attempted to use the ansible modules and it worked flawlessly, below is a sample playbook that will create a filter and add the associated filter entries.</description></item><item><title>Using UCS PowerTool To Set Equipment Labels</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2016/01/15/using-ucs-powertool-to-set-equipment-labels/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2016/01/15/using-ucs-powertool-to-set-equipment-labels/</guid><description>For conformity, we like to set the UCS Equipment labels to match the Service Profile Name. This allows us to match it quickly without having to dig down into the assigned profile. This script will set the UsrLbl and Name fields on the equipment tab to match the name of the Service Profile.

I had to download some support bundles for every chassis in our multiple zones. Instead of manually going through the GUI, I figured why not script it! This script will connect to each UCS domain and automatically generate a support bundle and download it for each chassis.

Since currently Cisco UCS does not allow selecting multiple VLAN&amp;rsquo;s easily when adding to a VLAN Group or vNIC Template, we now have a pretty decent script that will do it for you.
The script can be found here.

Upon further research, I noticed that &amp;ldquo;Native VLAN&amp;rdquo; was not selected. This is a must for any operating system that does not do VLAN Tagging such as ESXi.
So remember to set the VLAN to Native if using an operating system that does not support VLAN tagging!</description></item></channel></rss>
