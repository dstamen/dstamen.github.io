      <description>Another New Blog Platform! So it seems there is a bit of battle between the Jekll/Hugo/Ghost platforms. I have been trying to be a little more flexible with Jekyll and it was giving me issues, so I decided to switch to Hugo. After doing the redesign I have been getting feedback that it is much cleaner, so I hope you enjoy it too!
All links should be functional and moved nicely, if they dont work, please leave a comment!</description>

      <description>Did you know you could get host your own blog on Ravello Systems?
Its actually quite easy and even easier with Jekyll. Jekyll is a great static content platform perfect for hosting your blog. It is all based on html/css/markdown and requires absolutely no database.
Please use my previous blog on how to get it deployed.
Disclaimer: This is in no way supported or recommended by Ravello Systems, running this 24x7 even with 1CPU will consume most of your free trial/vExpert hours.</description>

      <description>So after getting my blog up and running I figured I would do a quick how-to, on how to get a blog up and running. Its actually something you can do in less than 15 minutes.
~ $ gem install jekyll ~ $ jekyll new myblog ~ $ cd myblog ~/myblog $ jekyll serve # =&amp;gt; Now browse to http://localhost:4000 and you will see the blog running!  Easy Enough? Now how do you create a blog post?</description>

      <description>New Blog Platform! I have had a bit of issues with performance on my blog recently and looking on how to not overpay for hosting services. A good friend of mine suggested using Jekyll and GitHub Pages, so I took the challenge. Within a day I was able to get my blog posts exported from Wordpress and published on a new platform and it was quite simple! Be on the lookout for some upcoming posts.</description>
