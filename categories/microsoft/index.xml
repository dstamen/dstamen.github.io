      <description>I have been knee deep in migrations, so after clicking through a few times to create clustered file shares, I finally decided to script them. Here is that script I thought I would share. Thanksfully there was the NTFSSecurity module published by microsoft that makes permissions a breeze. You can get more details by viewing the module page.

      <title>Identify DirSync Distribution Groups in Office365</title>

      <description>So after recently implementing directory sync i wanted to make sure any new groups were properly set up in active directory.
Unfortunately i was unable to find any commands so thanks to MS Support I was able to find a way to identify these. You would think it would be under Get-DistributionGroup but it is actually under Get-MSolGroup. After connecting via remote powershell you can run the below command to see all that are not synced.</description>

      <title>Horizon View 6 - Single Sign On with Published Applications</title>

      <guid>/2014/10/29/horizon-view-6-single-sign-on-with-published-applications/</guid>
      <description>So I have been working in a few situations where i have wanted to use Horizon 6 published (RDS) applications but having to either launch the Horizon View client within a VDI or have users be forced to logon again has been a deal breaker.
Upon further research i finally found the right combination of settings to allow users to launch the RDS Hosted Applications via a Shortcut and automatically login to the view client making this process seamless.</description>

      <title>Office 365/Exchange EAC Pop Ups not working with Chrome 37</title>

      <description>Chrome depreciated one of the features that allowed these popups to work, here is a temporary workaround to get it working.
Download the Chrome Policy Plugin here
 Open the zip file you just downloaded and locate the .ADM file that best matches your system: Extract the .ADM file to any folder on your hard drive Go to Start &amp;gt; Run, and run gpedit.msc Right-click Local Computer Policy &amp;gt; Computer Configuration &amp;gt; Administrative Templates, and select Add/Remove Templates: Add the adm template that you saved to disk earlier:   You should now see the template underneath a Google &amp;gt; Google Chrome section within Administrative Templates  Depending on which operating system you have, it might be under a Classic Administrative Templates (ADM) folder:    Click on Google Chrome in the left-hand pane and then double-click on the item called Enable deprecated web platform features in the list within the right-hand pane:   NOTE: It helps to sort the table in the right-hand pane by the Setting column in order to find the Enable deprecated web platform features item more easily.</description>

      <description>So upon trying to install .Net 3.5 on a new server today it would not allow me to, it kept telling me the source files were unavailable even after pointing to source directly to multiple ISO&#39;s and copied the files locally.
Upon further research I stumbled across this microsoft KB article and used it to ultimately find my fix. KB2734782
Here are the full steps I followed to get .NET installed.</description>

      <description>I don&#39;t know whats going on in the past few weeks but the sheer amount of zeroday exploits via email have risen. To protect yourselves against this I would recommend setting up a transport rule to drop or reject any email with executable content. This can be done for Exchange 2013 or Office365 (Exchange Online).
 Login to Exchange Admin Center using administrative credentials On the left pane select &amp;ldquo;Mail flow&amp;rdquo; On the top pane select &amp;quot; Rules&amp;rdquo; Click on the &amp;ldquo;+&amp;rdquo; sign and select create a new rule Give a name to the rule and select &amp;ldquo;more options&amp;rdquo; at the bottom of the page.</description>
