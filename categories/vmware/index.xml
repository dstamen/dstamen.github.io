In the previous post we discussed how to backup each individual component, in this post we will continue the conversation and discuss considerations to restore or rollback your vSphere Environment components.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="platform-services-controller--vcenter-server">Platform Services Controller / vCenter Server&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When things don&amp;rsquo;t go right with an update, upgrade or configuration change of your Platform Services Controller or vCenter Server you need to understand the proper steps it takes to rollback. In these scenarios sometimes there may have been a failure in the process, or after a successful upgrade was completed, an incompatibility was found which would result in a rollback. A reason we see the need to rollback a vCenter Server is when a supporting solution such as a backup vendor or monitoring vendor is not compatible. In this case you will need to revert to the previous version.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Considerations for vSphere Component Backup and Restore: Part 1</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2019/10/21/considerations-for-vsphere-component-backup-and-restore-part-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2019/10/21/considerations-for-vsphere-component-backup-and-restore-part-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>You spend time planning and implementing updates, upgrades and configuration changes to vSphere Environments.

&lt;h2 id="vcenter-ha-overview">vCenter HA Overview&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>vCenter HA has seen wide adoption as customers wish to provide provide high availability for their vCenter Server. VMware Solutions such as Site Recovery Manager, NSX and Horizon View rely heavily on the availability of the vCenter Server being online, so having a low RPO and RTO assists in availability of these business critical applications. vCenter Server 6.7 Update 1 introduced workflow improvements by bringing vCenter HA into the vSphere Client. There are no longer two separate Basic and Advanced workflows. If the vCenter Server is self-managed the passive and witness nodes will be automatically deployed. However, if the vCenter Server is not self-managed the workflow will prompt you for the managing vCenter Servers credential.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>VMworld 2019 - Sessions and Events</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2019/06/18/vmworld-2019-sessions-and-events/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2019/06/18/vmworld-2019-sessions-and-events/</guid><description>&lt;p>VMworld US 2019 is just around the corner and the session acceptance emails have just been sent out.

In our workshops one of the common things I hear is that most folks aren&amp;rsquo;t using the CLI based tools that have been included in the installer. I am a huge fan of these as they make migrations and upgrades seamless&amp;ndash;especially when having to perform the task if you have multiple PSC&amp;rsquo;s and vCenter Servers.

Every time I would run through a compliance check, they would always report they were up to date even when they were running an older version.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have recently made a breakthrough working with VMware Support and stumbling through some old blogs. Cisco Support has been terrible on this issue and after repeated attempts to get this case escalated i think the 10th time is a charm.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using PowerCLI to Install Host VIBs</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2016/03/03/using-powercli-to-install-host-vibs/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2016/03/03/using-powercli-to-install-host-vibs/</guid><description>&lt;p>So currently Cisco has an issue with installing their ENIC and FNIC VIBs through Update Manager for ESXi 6.x. Until that is resolved I need to manually push out patches to these hosts. Obviously I do not want to do this manually, so I will be utilizing PowerCLI to accomplish this task.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This process is very straight forward. We will begin with updating our Platform Service Controllers (PSC) and then proceed with the vCenter Appliance.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>SSH to your Primary PSC.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you are currently in the bash shell, type appliancesh to switch shells to run the update.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run software-packages install &amp;ndash;url &amp;ndash;acceptEulas to download and install the packages from the VMware Repo.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You can use the &amp;ndash;ISO switch or supply a custom url as well if needed.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sit back and wait. Once it is finished you will be prompted to reboot.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Reboot by typing shutdown reboot /r reason&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>

The problem is when I went to redeploy it I got the following error.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://davidstamen.com/images/unregistervcsaerror.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Decoding the error, I pretty much figured that the object already existed in the SSO database and I needed to delete the existing object. Here is how you do that.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Log in as root to the appliance shell of the Platform Services Controller appliance with which the vCenter Server Appliance is registered.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To enable the Bash shell, run the shell.set &amp;ndash;enabled true command.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Run the shell command to start the Bash shell and log in.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run the cmsso-util unregister command to unregister the powered off vCenter Server Appliance.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>cmsso-util unregister &amp;ndash;node-pnid vCenter-FQDNorIP &amp;ndash;username administrator@your_domain_name &amp;ndash;passwd vCenter-Single-Sign-On-password&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>vApp clusters
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The vApp cluster requires the deployment of the OS upgrade and the product upgrade .pak files.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>For an OS upgrade, the file is: vRealize_Operations_Manager-VA-OS-xxx.pak&lt;/li>

&lt;li>vApp heterogeneous clusters
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The vApp heterogeneous cluster requires the deployment of the OS upgrade and the product upgrade .pak files.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>For an OS upgrade, the file is: vRealize_Operations_Manager-VA-OS-xxx.pak&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For the product upgrade of a heterogeneous cluster that has VA nodes with Windows Remote Collectors, the file is: vRealize_Operations_Manager-VA-WIN-xxx.pak&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>RHEL standalone clusters
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The RHEL standalone cluster requires the deployment of only the product upgrade .pak file.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For the product upgrade of RHEL clusters, the file is: vRealize_Operations_Manager-RHEL-xxx.pak&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>RHEL heterogeneous clusters
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The RHEL heterogeneous cluster requires the deployment of only the product upgrade .pak file.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For the product upgrade of a heterogeneous cluster that has RHEL nodes with Windows Remote Collectors, the file is: vRealize_Operations_Manager-RHEL-WIN-xxx.pak&lt;/li>

I came across this issue with my first deployment of vSphere 6. Now I am circling back around to do a POC and it still exists.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When trying to join a Platform Services Controller to the domain via the vSphere Webclient I get the following error: &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;java.lang.reflect.invocationTargetException&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://davidstamen.com/images/pscdomainerror.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are currently two workarounds now with 6.0U1 I am aware of.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The first method is to join to the domain using the CLI.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="ln">1&lt;/span>&lt;span class="cl">/opt/likewise/bin/domainjoin-cli join domain username
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The second method is to use the new PSC interface to join to the domain.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Navigate to &lt;strong>https://fqdnofpsc/psc&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Select &lt;strong>Appliance Settings&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Click on &lt;strong>Manage&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Under &lt;strong>Active Directory&lt;/strong> Select Join and enter in your details&lt;/li>

&lt;p>The upgrade documentation can also be found &lt;a href="https://pubs.vmware.com/horizon-62-view/topic/com.vmware.ICbase/PDF/view-62-upgrades.pdf">here.&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Warning:&lt;/strong> In my environment I do not have a composer server, if you had one this would be upgraded first
The upgrade order is as follows. Composer Server, Connection Servers and then Security Servers.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Log on to your connection server and launch the executable.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>This script can be extremely handy as it will take care of extending the VMDK and then going to the OS and then performing the expansion there as well. This has been helpful when needing to extend a large batch of servers (60+).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Syntax:&lt;/strong> .\ExtendVMDKandGuest VMNAME&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will then be prompted to enter in the Hard Disk #, the size you want to be extended, and then which drive letter that volume belongs to.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using PowerCLI to Detach Luns</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2015/09/14/using-powercli-to-detach-luns/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2015/09/14/using-powercli-to-detach-luns/</guid><description>&lt;p>I thought I would share this script, its been circulating a bit but I feel it is a nice one to have in your toolkit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Have you ever had to remove a LUN from a cluster and thought &amp;ldquo;Do I really need to detach all the LUN&amp;rsquo;s, before un-mapping from my SAN?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Unmount Datastore&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Detach LUN&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Un-map from SAN&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rescan Cluster&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Well here is a handy script with output. All you need to do is unmount your datastore(s), and then enter in your naaid of your LUN&amp;rsquo;s and the cluster you want to remove it from, save it an execute. All the LUN&amp;rsquo;s will be detached without having to manually go and detach it from every LUN in your cluster.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>vSphere 6.0 Update 1 Released</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2015/09/10/vsphere-60-update-1-released/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2015/09/10/vsphere-60-update-1-released/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today vSphere 6.0 U1 is released.

The process is pretty straightforward, however I came across one hiccup I wanted to share.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am assuming you have already upgraded your View Composer, Connection and Security Servers and are now focused on getting the agents up to date.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Install/Update Agents on virtual desktops to 6.1.1 &lt;strong>(The HTML Access 3.4 client will not work with previous agent versions)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Install/Update Agents on RDS servers to 6.1.1&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Install the HTML Access 3.4 to all your connection servers within the appropriate enviroment if load balanced&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Now you can logon to your HTML Client and look for your published apps&amp;hellip;.however you will see that they are missing&amp;hellip;.looking into the actual guide for the html access there is an additional step.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.vmware.com/pdf/horizon-view/horizon-html-access-3x-document.pdf">HTML Access Guide&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;ol start="5">
&lt;li>Log on to a connection server running 6.1.1 (If you are in a mixed enviroment this change cannot be made on a previous version.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Navigate to Farms and then edit each RDS farm to enable HTML Access.
&lt;img src="https://davidstamen.com/images/Screen-Shot-2015-06-10-at-10.53.53-AM.png#center" alt="">&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Voila you now have access to all your applications via the HTML client with a fancy new interface!

&lt;p>Upon further research it seems this is a known issue and is resolved in ESXi 5.1 Express Patch 5 &lt;a href="http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/search.do?cmd=displayKC&amp;amp;docType=kc&amp;amp;docTypeID=DT_KB_1_1&amp;amp;externalId=2077640">KB2077640&lt;/a> as referenced in this article &lt;a href="http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&amp;amp;cmd=displayKC&amp;amp;externalId=2078352">KB2078352&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However the hotfix only fixes future occurences, you still need to fix all the VMs affected. See below for the powercli script I created to connect to all my vcenters, get VM&amp;rsquo;s that are affected and then fix them. Please note as this is not referenced in the KB that the VM will need to be POWERED OFF and then POWERED ON for the change to go into affect. A restart will not fix it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Configuring ESXi 5.5 Dump Collector</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2014/06/10/configuring-esxi-5-5-dump-collector/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2014/06/10/configuring-esxi-5-5-dump-collector/</guid><description>&lt;p>Thank you to everyone who listened to me on the EMEA vBrownbag.
