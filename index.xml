      <description>Previously I covered how to use the VCSA Installer to do a scripted upgrade and then I covered Patching the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) using the REST API - Part 1 (Postman Collection) However, after learning recently how to call API&amp;rsquo;s from Powershell I thought to myself, why not write a Powershell Module for this?
Introduction Using tools such as Postman can make it utilizing API&amp;rsquo;s a bit easier, but you still need to be familiar with a separate tool or UI.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you havent heard vSphere 6.7 U1 is now out and is loaded with all new features! If you have used 6.7 GA you may have noticed the Auto Deploy functionality did not yet make it into the long awaited vSphere Client. With vCenter Server 6.7 U1 we now have feature parity and this means Auto Deploy has been added to the vSphere Client. Lets jump in and see some of the new functionality that has been included.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are on the home stretch of our Automating your vSphere Upgrade blog series. The final step of completing our upgrade will be upgrading our Virtual Distributed Switch (VDS). When upgrading your VDS on vSphere 6.7 the version is actually 6.6 (we will cover the details later). Please make sure prior to upgrading your VDS to 6.6 all ESXi hosts have been upgraded to ESXi 6.7, if you still have hosts on ESXi 6.5 you will only be able to upgrade to version 6.5.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Next up in our Automating your vSphere Upgrade blog series is your VMFS Datastore. vSphere 6.5 and vSphere 6.7 both support the latest VMFS-6. Once all of your ESXi hosts that are connected to the VMFS-5 datastore have been upgraded to vSphere 6.5 or vSphere 6.7 you can then proceed to migrate your datastore to VMFS-6.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first topic we will cover in our Automating your vSphere Upgrade series is updating our core infrastructure. Upgrading Platform Services Controller(PSC)  and vCenter Server via the CLI installer. In our workshops one of the common things I hear is that most folks aren&amp;rsquo;t using the CLI based tools that have been included in the installer. I am a huge fan of these as they make migrations and upgrades seamless&amp;ndash;especially when having to perform the task if you have multiple PSC&amp;rsquo;s and vCenter Servers. Using the CLI tools don’t have to be intimidating, as we go through this blog we will cover some how-to&amp;rsquo;s and benefits of using the CLI based approach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Since then I have seen quite a few threads come up and thought i would address them from a patching perspective.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been using 6.7 through the vSphere Beta Program and testing even newer features in my current role. I am here to talk to you about planning your vSphere upgrade and some planning and considerations you should have when going to the latest release.
The first, thing I would like to mention is there is no supported migration from vSphere 5.</description>

      <description>Another lovely Friday starting off with strange issues, when taking a host out of standard maintenance we noticed that HA would not reconfigure, and kept saying The object &amp;lsquo;vim.Datastore:datastore-1131&amp;rsquo; has already been deleted or has not been completely created. This was strange because no other hosts had this issue.
I proceeded to follow standard troubleshooting steps, reconfigure HA&amp;hellip;same issue&amp;hellip;.disable HA for entire cluster and re-enable&amp;hellip;..same issue&amp;hellip;whoops thats not good!
First step, check what luns are available to the cluster.</description>

      <description>Happy New Year! So towards the end of the year I kind of slacked on writing some blog posts, when I finally did I realized I had no clue how to create a post. I know&amp;hellip;I know this is terrible, however its still much better than wordpress. I stumbled across an awesome tool that would help you manage your hugo/jekyll website Forestry.io
It is quite simple, you login with your Github, Bitbucket, etc account and it can detect your existing repositories.</description>

I had set a personal goal at the beginning of the year, that I would pass the VCAP6-DCV Design and unfortunately after months of studying I took it and failed in March. I was ready to give up based on the cost of the exam and the time i spent studying. However, I found out recently that a new version based on 6.</description>

      <description>I have been looking for a new desk for awhile. Working from home I do not get to go into an office, or walk around to meet up with coworkers. I found myself sitting for way too long which hasn&amp;rsquo;t been best for the low back and leg pains I experience.
I heard from a friend that getting a standing desk may be something that would be good. Standing desks come in all shapes and sizes but I knew from the start that I wanted a dedicated standing desk and just not a riser (one that sits on an existing desk).</description>

      <description>So it seems to be that time of year again with new projects coming around. This time its all about vRA. This is probably my first of many blogs to come about things I have come across.
My question today was how do I pre-create a computer AD account, join a device to the domain and then clean it up when the machine is destroyed.
Turns out this is super simple in vRealize Automation 7.</description>

      <description>vSphere 6.5U1 was released on July 27th. This is an incremental update a lot of people wait for before upgrading from a previous version. I have been lucky to have been running on vSphere 6.5 for quite some time and have been enjoying it very much.
Obviously we never upgrade production first, if we can help it. I decided to attempt an upgrade on one of our QA vCenters that was deployed using the VCHA Advanced workflow.</description>

      <description>Another New Blog Platform! So it seems there is a bit of battle between the Jekll/Hugo/Ghost platforms. I have been trying to be a little more flexible with Jekyll and it was giving me issues, so I decided to switch to Hugo. After doing the redesign I have been getting feedback that it is much cleaner, so I hope you enjoy it too!

This particular one included 73 different vSOM keys, and as you may know there is currently no way to enter in multiple keys at a time. I reached out to Kyle Ruddy and he informed me there is an API to do this, and that started my adventure to get this working.</description>

      <description>Warning: A few others and myself have noticed that when updating a VCHA Cluster to 6.5U1 it resets the hostname to localhost.localdomain stopping vCenter Web Client from Loading. It seems to be isolated to Advanced Deployments and not Basic. I would recommend destroying your VCHA Cluster, updating, then redeploying in this scenario. Warning2: It also seems that if you try to redeploy VCHA Advanced after an upgrade, it still resets the hostname, I have a case opened and will update here as neccessary.</description>

I have been working on a Migration from PowerDNS using a MySQL DB. We have a custom solution which gets updated and gets pushed to Akamai. The problem is, this custom solution requires all the zones to be in bind format. Doing some research I found out there is no easy way to get these zones into a bind zone file.</description>

I figured since I am using the embedded SSO, I could update the login page to show any information for that particular node.</description>

      <description>So VMware Flings have been on a roll recently. They have released what they call &amp;ldquo;VMware Content Library Assistant.&amp;rdquo; This is a java based CLI app, that connects to your vCenter and searchers for your templates and then automatically creates and uploads them.
You can find the fling at the following URL&amp;hellip;https://labs.vmware.com/flings/vsphere-content-library-assistant)
Once you download the fling, you can just run the following command.
java -jar sphere-content-library-assistant-1.0.jar -s servername -u username -p password  In my case my java home isn&amp;rsquo;t setup on my mac so I had to run the following command to get it to work.</description>

If you are installing this on a bare metal or virtual machine, i suggest a debian based image.</description>

      <description>So as everyone has probably seen, vSphere 6.5 is now GA. One of the features i have been waiting for the most is vCenter HA. I have spent some time trying to get this working in my lab. Unfortunately after countless tries i was stuck. Thanks to folks in the vExpert Slack for helping me try to resolve this, but unfortunately this was a case for VMware Support.
Every time I would try to configure vCenter HA using the Advanced Wizard, I would get the following error.</description>

My experience with the exam was actually pretty good. The new interface for the advanced exams is that of an HOL. You are dropped onto the desktop and have a window that slides in and out to pull up the manual and other consoles.
I would definately read up on Josh Andrew&amp;rsquo;s post about what to expect.</description>

      <description>I have been constantly trying to figure out the best way to deploy updated agents to some of our virtual desktops. It isnt a large environment so I have no need for SCCM or other deployment tools, but its big enough having to RDP to each VM was a pain. I finally decided to bang out a script, and surprised how well it works.

      <description>We have multiple clusters within our vCenters that are defined as a rack. Each rack has its own storage, so storage is not shared between clusters. I needed to develop a way to easily replicate templates between clusters, so a local copy existed on each cluster to take advantage of VAAI.
I really wanted to utilize the vSphere Content Libary for these, but there is currently no publicly available documentation on how to deploy a VM from a Content Library via a Script.</description>

      <description>For conformity, we like to set the UCS Equipment labels to match the Service Profile Name. This allows us to match it quickly without having to dig down into the assigned profile. This script will set the UsrLbl and Name fields on the equipment tab to match the name of the Service Profile.

      <description>For the past week, I have been troubleshooting the strangest issue. I have been attempting to move some Windows 8.1 VM&amp;rsquo;s from our legacy datacenter(iSCSI) to our new datacenter(FC).
Whenever I would move the VM to our new DC, it would fail to boot properly. It would boot straight to Windows Recovery. If I moved the same VM to any other type of storage(NFS, iSCSI, Local) the VM would boot perfectly fine.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my post about upgrading your VMware vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) to 6.0 U1b.
This process is very straight forward. We will begin with updating our Platform Service Controllers (PSC) and then proceed with the vCenter Appliance.
 SSH to your Primary PSC. If you are currently in the bash shell, type appliancesh to switch shells to run the update. Run software-packages install &amp;ndash;url &amp;ndash;acceptEulas to download and install the packages from the VMware Repo.</description>

      <description>Normally when i need to install and update a host VIB I use Update Manager. However there is currently a bug with Cisco&amp;rsquo;s latest enic/fnic drivers that wont let you install them via UM.
I had to run these updates on over 50 hosts and I really didn&amp;rsquo;t want to have to ssh and install it manually. Lucky I remember Brian Graf&amp;rsquo;s Host Client Install Fling and borrowed some of the code to come up with the below script.</description>

      <description>Ever needed to modify a DVS uplink configuration from ESXi Shell? I am currently troubleshooting some issues with DVS uplinks no longer being assigned on reboot.
As a heads up. If you are doing this on ESXi 6.0.. don&amp;rsquo;t. It can cause an issue with the proxy DVS having different ID than the actual DVS causing my original issue, still working with VMware Support to find out more details.
After &amp;ldquo;Restoring Network Configuration&amp;rdquo; a few too many times, I finally realized I could just add the uplinks back via CLI until support can figure out why this is occurring, here are the details on how to manage the uplinks on a DVS via CLI.</description>

      <description>We are currently working on some Cisco ACI Integration and wanted to add a large VLAN Pool to a UCS Configuration.
Since currently Cisco UCS does not allow selecting multiple VLAN&amp;rsquo;s easily when adding to a VLAN Group or vNIC Template, we now have a pretty decent script that will do it for you.
The script can be found here.

I was working on deploying some test VM&amp;rsquo;s and for some reason all the VM&amp;rsquo;s that were cloned decided to start with the network disconnected, and the connect on power on was also not selected.
I decided to throw together this quick one-liner that will make sure every VM is set to start connected on power on and is currently connected.</description>

      <description>So I am in the process of doing some vSphere 6 testing and needed to test a redeployment of one of my VCSA&amp;rsquo;s. The problem is when I went to redeploy it I got the following error.
Decoding the error, I pretty much figured that the object already existed in the SSO database and I needed to delete the existing object. Here is how you do that.
 Log in as root to the appliance shell of the Platform Services Controller appliance with which the vCenter Server Appliance is registered.</description>

      <description>With all this talk about VMware vs KVM I figured that I would attempt to load a base install of KVM to see what it was all about.
Here is a quick vagrant runbook that will quickly get a 3 linux servers deployed and installed with KVM to play with.
There are 3 nodes..MGMT01,KVM01 and KVM02. I use MGMT01 VMM to manage KVM01 and KVM02.

      <description>I wanted to share this handy script i created when you have a need to build out a new vCenter.
This script can be extremely handy as it will take care of creating the datacenter, cluster, adding hosts, creating datastores and then applying the appropriate host profile. It is all done via CSV files so it is extremely customizable.
Files to modify to customize your configuration  createdatacenter.csv - Contains the name of the datacenter to create.</description>

I have also rolled it into a Vagrant package so you can easily test it on your own, and execute the scripts by themselves against your environment to deploy.

When trying to join a Platform Services Controller to the domain via the vSphere Webclient I get the following error: &amp;ldquo;java.lang.reflect.invocationTargetException&amp;rdquo;
There are currently two workarounds now with 6.0U1 I am aware of.
 The first method is to join to the domain using the CLI.</description>

This post will explain how to enable it, as its not really something greatly documented right now. I think they are aware and hopefully in a future update this will be easier.
Here is a link to the current VMware documentation.
NOTE: This feature does require a 3rd party trusted signed certificate to work. From my current testing and speaking with others self-signed certificates will not function.</description>

This script can be extremely handy as it will take care of extending the VMDK and then going to the OS and then performing the expansion there as well. This has been helpful when needing to extend a large batch of servers (60+).
Syntax: .\ExtendVMDKandGuest VMNAME
You will then be prompted to enter in the Hard Disk #, the size you want to be extended, and then which drive letter that volume belongs to.</description>

You see, VMware has had a bug KB2124669 since ESXi 6.0 that can cause an ESXi host to randomly lose connection, freeze and overall act really terrible. With the release of 6.0U1 it still exists.</description>

However as most of us have seen, when a user is logged onto the guest the screen is shown in the console. In some organizations this may pose a privacy or security risk.
Right now there is no true workaround as that is how the view session is handled, however there is a workaround to disable console access.</description>

Initial Thoughts Today I sat and took the VCP6-DCV Delta Exam beta. I have never taken a VMware beta exam so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite sure what to expect, from what I have been told, I expected lots of questions with bad grammar and horrible spelling. However today I got something a bit different. Ill explain it best without violating any NDA.</description>

Working with VMware support we were finally able to get it working with a few tweaks and there is a current pending KB that has not been published yet. (KB2113038) I have been told this affects both an embedded deployment (VCSA and PSC together) and external deployment (VCSA and PSC seperate.</description>

I had a need to extend the drives on about 50 VMs today and really didn&amp;rsquo;t want to do all that clicking. I remember awhile back it was easy to do this with a Basic Set-Harddisk and use the -ResizeGuestPartition but alas that has been removed from the current functionality. So I took my search to google and found a couple scripts that worked ok, but nothing that was a seamless experience.</description>

      <description>I was in the process of getting vRealize for Horizon configured, and as I was going through the broker agent configuration for the life of me I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get the eventdb portion to work. Everytime i entered in the user name and password, I would receive the following error. FAILED (Format of the initialization string does not conform to specification starting at index 88.)
I knew it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a password issue as I was able to logon to SQL Manager with no issue, and the Horizon View EventsDB was working fine, so I went on a google search to try to hunt through logs.</description>

      <description>I use a customized version of http://www.virtu-al.net/vcheck-pluginsheaders/vcheck/ by Alan Renouf to connect to multiple servers. However a coworker of mine was trying to run it, and the script would only return data from the 2nd vCenter we were connecting to.
Doing some troubleshooting we noticed their DefaultVIServerMode was set to single. This means that only a single servers connection will occur at once. Changing this setting is very easy, there are 3 scopes, but only one really needs to be set.</description>

Upon further research I have identified a good step by step to replace the trend micro DSM certificate and include subject alternative names using a Microsoft certificate authority.
 Stop the “Trend Micro Deep Security Manager” service If not already created, create a folder on the root of C:\ called “certs” Go to C:\Program Files\Trend Micro\Deep Security Manager and create a new folder called “Backupkeystore” Copy .</description>

      <description>So after recently implementing directory sync i wanted to make sure any new groups were properly set up in active directory.
Unfortunately i was unable to find any commands so thanks to MS Support I was able to find a way to identify these. You would think it would be under Get-DistributionGroup but it is actually under Get-MSolGroup. After connecting via remote powershell you can run the below command to see all that are not synced.</description>

      <description>So I have been working in a few situations where i have wanted to use Horizon 6 published (RDS) applications but having to either launch the Horizon View client within a VDI or have users be forced to logon again has been a deal breaker.
Upon further research i finally found the right combination of settings to allow users to launch the RDS Hosted Applications via a Shortcut and automatically login to the view client making this process seamless.</description>

      <description>Chrome depreciated one of the features that allowed these popups to work, here is a temporary workaround to get it working.
Download the Chrome Policy Plugin here
 Open the zip file you just downloaded and locate the .ADM file that best matches your system: Extract the .ADM file to any folder on your hard drive Go to Start &amp;gt; Run, and run gpedit.msc Right-click Local Computer Policy &amp;gt; Computer Configuration &amp;gt; Administrative Templates, and select Add/Remove Templates: Add the adm template that you saved to disk earlier: You should now see the template underneath a Google &amp;gt; Google Chrome section within Administrative Templates 2.</description>

Upon further research it seems this is a known issue and is resolved in ESXi 5.1 Express Patch 5 KB2077640 as referenced in this article KB2078352.
However the hotfix only fixes future occurences, you still need to fix all the VMs affected.</description>

Once I got access I knew I wanted to copy some of my existing workloads to vCHS instead of having to start from scratch. I begin to look for some good guides on implementing vCloud Connector 2.</description>

Upon further research, I noticed that &amp;ldquo;Native VLAN&amp;rdquo; was not selected. This is a must for any operating system that does not do VLAN Tagging such as ESXi.
So remember to set the VLAN to Native if using an operating system that does not support VLAN tagging!</description>
