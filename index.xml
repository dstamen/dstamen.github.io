In the previous post we discussed how to backup each individual component, in this post we will continue the conversation and discuss considerations to restore or rollback your vSphere Environment components.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="platform-services-controller--vcenter-server">Platform Services Controller / vCenter Server&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When things don&amp;rsquo;t go right with an update, upgrade or configuration change of your Platform Services Controller or vCenter Server you need to understand the proper steps it takes to rollback. In these scenarios sometimes there may have been a failure in the process, or after a successful upgrade was completed, an incompatibility was found which would result in a rollback. A reason we see the need to rollback a vCenter Server is when a supporting solution such as a backup vendor or monitoring vendor is not compatible. In this case you will need to revert to the previous version.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Considerations for vSphere Component Backup and Restore: Part 1</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2019/10/21/considerations-for-vsphere-component-backup-and-restore-part-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2019/10/21/considerations-for-vsphere-component-backup-and-restore-part-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>You spend time planning and implementing updates, upgrades and configuration changes to vSphere Environments.

If you have wondered what it takes to handle the lifecycle of a vCenter HA enabled vCenter Server, keep reading!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="vcenter-ha-overview">vCenter HA Overview&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>vCenter HA has seen wide adoption as customers wish to provide provide high availability for their vCenter Server. VMware Solutions such as Site Recovery Manager, NSX and Horizon View rely heavily on the availability of the vCenter Server being online, so having a low RPO and RTO assists in availability of these business critical applications. vCenter Server 6.7 Update 1 introduced workflow improvements by bringing vCenter HA into the vSphere Client. There are no longer two separate Basic and Advanced workflows. If the vCenter Server is self-managed the passive and witness nodes will be automatically deployed. However, if the vCenter Server is not self-managed the workflow will prompt you for the managing vCenter Servers credential.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>VMworld 2019 - Sessions and Events</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2019/06/18/vmworld-2019-sessions-and-events/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2019/06/18/vmworld-2019-sessions-and-events/</guid><description>&lt;p>VMworld US 2019 is just around the corner and the session acceptance emails have just been sent out.

The answer may not be as easy as it seems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have been working on a Migration from PowerDNS using a MySQL DB. We have a custom solution which gets updated and gets pushed to Akamai. The problem is, this custom solution requires all the zones to be in bind format. Doing some research I found out there is no easy way to get these zones into a bind zone file. You could setup a secondary server and do zone transfers, but that wouldnt meet my requirements.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Functional Branding of vSphere Web Client Logon Page</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2017/01/19/functional-branding-of-vsphere-web-client-logon-page/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2017/01/19/functional-branding-of-vsphere-web-client-logon-page/</guid><description>&lt;p>I had a use case I wanted to investigate in regards to the new VCHA that is part of VMware vCenter Server 6.5. One thing I noticed, is when you have VCHA configured, there is no way to know which node of the HA cluster you are connecting to without being logged on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As people have noted before &lt;a href="http://www.virtuallyghetto.com/2015/02/how-to-customize-the-new-vsphere-6-0-web-client-login-ui.html">William Lam&amp;rsquo;s - How to Customize Webclient Login UI&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This process is very straight forward. We will begin with updating our Platform Service Controllers (PSC) and then proceed with the vCenter Appliance.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>SSH to your Primary PSC.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you are currently in the bash shell, type appliancesh to switch shells to run the update.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run software-packages install &amp;ndash;url &amp;ndash;acceptEulas to download and install the packages from the VMware Repo.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You can use the &amp;ndash;ISO switch or supply a custom url as well if needed.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sit back and wait. Once it is finished you will be prompted to reboot.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Reboot by typing shutdown reboot /r reason&lt;/li>

&lt;p>After &amp;ldquo;Restoring Network Configuration&amp;rdquo; a few too many times, I finally realized I could just add the uplinks back via CLI until support can figure out why this is occurring, here are the details on how to manage the uplinks on a DVS via CLI.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Configuring Multiple UCS VLAN's</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2015/11/23/configuring-multiple-ucs-vlans/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2015/11/23/configuring-multiple-ucs-vlans/</guid><description>&lt;p>We are currently working on some Cisco ACI Integration and wanted to add a large VLAN Pool to a UCS Configuration.&lt;/p>

The problem is when I went to redeploy it I got the following error.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://davidstamen.com/images/unregistervcsaerror.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Decoding the error, I pretty much figured that the object already existed in the SSO database and I needed to delete the existing object. Here is how you do that.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Log in as root to the appliance shell of the Platform Services Controller appliance with which the vCenter Server Appliance is registered.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To enable the Bash shell, run the shell.set &amp;ndash;enabled true command.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Run the shell command to start the Bash shell and log in.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run the cmsso-util unregister command to unregister the powered off vCenter Server Appliance.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>cmsso-util unregister &amp;ndash;node-pnid vCenter-FQDNorIP &amp;ndash;username administrator@your_domain_name &amp;ndash;passwd vCenter-Single-Sign-On-password&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>vApp clusters
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The vApp cluster requires the deployment of the OS upgrade and the product upgrade .pak files.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>For an OS upgrade, the file is: vRealize_Operations_Manager-VA-OS-xxx.pak&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For the product upgrade of vApp clusters, the file is: vRealize_Operations_Manager-VA-xxx.pak&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>vApp heterogeneous clusters
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The vApp heterogeneous cluster requires the deployment of the OS upgrade and the product upgrade .pak files.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>For an OS upgrade, the file is: vRealize_Operations_Manager-VA-OS-xxx.pak&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For the product upgrade of a heterogeneous cluster that has VA nodes with Windows Remote Collectors, the file is: vRealize_Operations_Manager-VA-WIN-xxx.pak&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>RHEL standalone clusters
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The RHEL standalone cluster requires the deployment of only the product upgrade .pak file.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For the product upgrade of RHEL clusters, the file is: vRealize_Operations_Manager-RHEL-xxx.pak&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>RHEL heterogeneous clusters
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The RHEL heterogeneous cluster requires the deployment of only the product upgrade .pak file.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For the product upgrade of a heterogeneous cluster that has RHEL nodes with Windows Remote Collectors, the file is: vRealize_Operations_Manager-RHEL-WIN-xxx.pak&lt;/li>

I came across this issue with my first deployment of vSphere 6. Now I am circling back around to do a POC and it still exists.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When trying to join a Platform Services Controller to the domain via the vSphere Webclient I get the following error: &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;java.lang.reflect.invocationTargetException&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://davidstamen.com/images/pscdomainerror.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are currently two workarounds now with 6.0U1 I am aware of.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The first method is to join to the domain using the CLI.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="ln">1&lt;/span>&lt;span class="cl">/opt/likewise/bin/domainjoin-cli join domain username
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The second method is to use the new PSC interface to join to the domain.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Navigate to &lt;strong>https://fqdnofpsc/psc&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Select &lt;strong>Appliance Settings&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Click on &lt;strong>Manage&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Under &lt;strong>Active Directory&lt;/strong> Select Join and enter in your details&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Warning:&lt;/strong> In my environment I do not have a composer server, if you had one this would be upgraded first
The upgrade order is as follows. Composer Server, Connection Servers and then Security Servers.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Log on to your connection server and launch the executable.&lt;/li>

With the release of 6.0U1 it still exists.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Deploying and Hosting Jekyll on Ravello Systems</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2015/09/08/deploying-and-hosting-jekyll-on-ravello-systems/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2015/09/08/deploying-and-hosting-jekyll-on-ravello-systems/</guid><description>&lt;p>Did you know you could get host your own blog on &lt;a href="http://ravellosystems.com/">Ravello Systems&lt;/a>?&lt;/p>

I decided I would run it on Ubuntu Server using NGINX as the web platform.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is a quick vagrant runbook that will quickly get a linux server deployed and install NGINX to host your website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The code can be found &lt;a href="https://github.com/dstamen/Vagrant/tree/master/jekyll-nginx">here.&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The bootstrap_linux_nginx.sh file runs the following commands to install NGINX. You can add commands to your file to automatically create your configuration and sites to publish automatically. By default this will just bring up the default nginx site.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Welcome to Jekyll!</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2015/09/04/updated-platform/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2015/09/04/updated-platform/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="new-blog-platform">New Blog Platform!&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I have had a bit of issues with performance on my blog recently and looking on how to not overpay for hosting services.

The process is pretty straightforward, however I came across one hiccup I wanted to share.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am assuming you have already upgraded your View Composer, Connection and Security Servers and are now focused on getting the agents up to date.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Install/Update Agents on virtual desktops to 6.1.1 &lt;strong>(The HTML Access 3.4 client will not work with previous agent versions)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Install/Update Agents on RDS servers to 6.1.1&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Install the HTML Access 3.4 to all your connection servers within the appropriate enviroment if load balanced&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Now you can logon to your HTML Client and look for your published apps&amp;hellip;.however you will see that they are missing&amp;hellip;.looking into the actual guide for the html access there is an additional step.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.vmware.com/pdf/horizon-view/horizon-html-access-3x-document.pdf">HTML Access Guide&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;ol start="5">
&lt;li>Log on to a connection server running 6.1.1 (If you are in a mixed enviroment this change cannot be made on a previous version.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Navigate to Farms and then edit each RDS farm to enable HTML Access.
&lt;img src="https://davidstamen.com/images/Screen-Shot-2015-06-10-at-10.53.53-AM.png#center" alt="">&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Voila you now have access to all your applications via the HTML client with a fancy new interface!

Upon further research I have identified a good step by step to replace the trend micro DSM certificate and include subject alternative names using a Microsoft certificate authority.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Stop the “Trend Micro Deep Security Manager” service&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If not already created, create a folder on the root of C:\ called “certs”&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Go to C:\Program Files\Trend Micro\Deep Security Manager and create a new folder called “Backupkeystore”&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Copy .keystore and configuration.properties to Backupkeystore folder&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Open administrative command line &amp;amp; change directory to “C:\Program Files \Trend Mirco\Deep Security Manager\jre\bin\”&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run this command “keytool -genkey -alias tomcat -keyalg RSA -dname cn=(FQDN of Server)”.
This will create a “.keystore” file under the C:\Users\ directory&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When prompted for password enter a password for the keystore.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run this command “keytool -certreq -keyalg RSA -alias tomcat -file certrequest.txt”&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When prompted for password use same password as entered in step 6.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Open the certrequest.txt located in C:\Program Files \Trend Micro\Deep Security Manager\jre\bin\ and copy the contents of the file.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Access the CA server site &lt;a href="https://certsrv">https://certsrv&lt;/a> and click “Request a certificate”.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Select “advanced certificate request”&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Select “Submit a certificate request by using a base-64-encoded CMC or PKCS #10 file, or submit a renewal request by using a base-64-encoded PKCS #7 file”&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Paste copied text from certrequest.txt in “Base-64-encoded certificate request” field, select “Web Server” under Certificate Template and enter Subject Alternative Names under Additional Attributes using the following format: “san:dns=&amp;amp;dns=” and click “Submit.”&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Click “Download certificate chain” and save as “trend.p7b” in the certs folder on the C: drive&lt;/li>
&lt;li>From administrative command prompt run this command “keytool -import -trustcacerts -alias tomcat -file C:\certs\trend.p7b -keystore C:\Users\.keystore”&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When prompted for password use same password as entered in step 6.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When prompted to “Install reply anyway”, type “yes”&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Copy .keystore from C:\Users%username%\ and paste it into C:\Program Files \Trend Micro\Deep Security Manager&lt;/li>
&lt;li>From administrative command prompt change directories to C:\Program Files \Trend Micro\Deep Security Manager and run this command “.\configuration.properties”. This will open the configuration.properties in notepad.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Look for the line keystorePass= and delete the entry after the = symbol, enter the password used in step 6 after the = and save and close the file.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Restart the “Trend Micro Deep Security Manager” service&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol></description></item><item><title>Cisco Champion 2015</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2014/11/26/cisco-champion-2015/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2014/11/26/cisco-champion-2015/</guid><description>&lt;p>I am honored to have been accepted as a Cisco Champion for 2015!

&lt;p>Download the Chrome Policy Plugin &lt;a href="http://dl.google.com/dl/edgedl/chrome/policy/policy_templates.zip">here&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Open the zip file you just downloaded and locate the .ADM file that best matches your system:&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Extract the .ADM file to any folder on your hard drive&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Go to Start &amp;gt; Run, and run gpedit.msc&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Right-click Local Computer Policy &amp;gt; Computer Configuration &amp;gt; Administrative Templates, and select Add/Remove Templates:&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add the adm template that you saved to disk earlier:&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You should now see the template underneath a Google &amp;gt; Google Chrome section within Administrative Templates&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>Depending on which operating system you have, it might be under a Classic Administrative Templates (ADM) folder:&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;ol start="6">
&lt;li>Click on Google Chrome in the left-hand pane and then double-click on the item called Enable deprecated web platform features in the list within the right-hand pane:&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>NOTE: It helps to sort the table in the right-hand pane by the Setting column in order to find the Enable deprecated web platform features item more easily.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;ol start="7">
&lt;li>In the new screen that appears, click the Enabled radio button:&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the Options section of the same screen, click the Show… button&lt;/li>
&lt;li>On the new screen that appears, type ShowModalDialog_EffectiveUntil20150430 into the first cell of the table that’s displayed and hit ENTER:
-IMPORTANT NOTE: Make sure there are no spaces either before or after the ShowModalDialog_EffectiveUntil20150430 Otherwise, Chrome will reject the setting (see the Troubleshooting section for more information).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Click OK&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To verify that this policy has taken effect, navigate to the following URL in Chrome: chrome://policy&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If everything is set up correctly, you should see a screen like the following&lt;/li>

Reviewing the customization logs(C:\windows\temp\vmware-imc\guestcust.log) I noticed the following error..Unable to set customization status in vmx.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Upon further research it seems this is a known issue and is resolved in ESXi 5.1 Express Patch 5 &lt;a href="http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/search.do?cmd=displayKC&amp;amp;docType=kc&amp;amp;docTypeID=DT_KB_1_1&amp;amp;externalId=2077640">KB2077640&lt;/a> as referenced in this article &lt;a href="http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&amp;amp;cmd=displayKC&amp;amp;externalId=2078352">KB2078352&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However the hotfix only fixes future occurences, you still need to fix all the VMs affected. See below for the powercli script I created to connect to all my vcenters, get VM&amp;rsquo;s that are affected and then fix them. Please note as this is not referenced in the KB that the VM will need to be POWERED OFF and then POWERED ON for the change to go into affect. A restart will not fix it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Configuring ESXi 5.5 Dump Collector</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2014/06/10/configuring-esxi-5-5-dump-collector/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2014/06/10/configuring-esxi-5-5-dump-collector/</guid><description>&lt;p>Thank you to everyone who listened to me on the EMEA vBrownbag.

&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Login to Exchange Admin Center using administrative credentials&lt;/li>
&lt;li>On the left pane select &amp;ldquo;Mail flow&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>On the top pane select &amp;quot; Rules&amp;quot;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Click on the &amp;ldquo;+&amp;rdquo; sign and select create a new rule&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Give a name to the rule and select &amp;ldquo;more options&amp;rdquo; at the bottom of the page.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Under &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;Apply the rule if&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong> Select &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;Any attachment has executable content&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Under &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;Do the following&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong> Select &amp;ldquo;Reject the message with explanation&amp;rdquo; and input your text.&lt;/li>

Upon further research, I noticed that &amp;ldquo;Native VLAN&amp;rdquo; was not selected. This is a must for any operating system that does not do VLAN Tagging such as ESXi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So remember to set the VLAN to Native if using an operating system that does not support VLAN tagging!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Nested ESXi and NFS</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2014/04/29/nested-esxi-and-nfs/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2014/04/29/nested-esxi-and-nfs/</guid><description>&lt;p>I was working today on configuring NFS/Openfiler in my lab and came across an issue that my nested ESXi host&amp;rsquo;s couldn&amp;rsquo;t talk over the VSS (Standard Switch) I created.
