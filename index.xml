In the previous post we discussed how to backup each individual component, in this post we will continue the conversation and discuss considerations to restore or rollback your vSphere Environment components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="platform-services-controller--vcenter-server"&gt;Platform Services Controller / vCenter Server&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When things don&amp;rsquo;t go right with an update, upgrade or configuration change of your Platform Services Controller or vCenter Server you need to understand the proper steps it takes to rollback. In these scenarios sometimes there may have been a failure in the process, or after a successful upgrade was completed, an incompatibility was found which would result in a rollback. A reason we see the need to rollback a vCenter Server is when a supporting solution such as a backup vendor or monitoring vendor is not compatible. In this case you will need to revert to the previous version.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Considerations for vSphere Component Backup and Restore: Part 1</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2019/10/21/considerations-for-vsphere-component-backup-and-restore-part-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2019/10/21/considerations-for-vsphere-component-backup-and-restore-part-1/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;You spend time planning and implementing updates, upgrades and configuration changes to vSphere Environments. Rollback or recovery is usually the last thing on the mind. Did you know there are multiple ways to successfully backup each component in a vSphere Environment? There are also many ways to recover those same components.&lt;/p&gt;

When it comes to upgrading or updating your vCenter HA environment there are some specific considerations. If you have wondered what it takes to handle the lifecycle of a vCenter HA enabled vCenter Server, keep reading!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vcenter-ha-overview"&gt;vCenter HA Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;vCenter HA has seen wide adoption as customers wish to provide provide high availability for their vCenter Server. VMware Solutions such as Site Recovery Manager, NSX and Horizon View rely heavily on the availability of the vCenter Server being online, so having a low RPO and RTO assists in availability of these business critical applications. vCenter Server 6.7 Update 1 introduced workflow improvements by bringing vCenter HA into the vSphere Client. There are no longer two separate Basic and Advanced workflows. If the vCenter Server is self-managed the passive and witness nodes will be automatically deployed. However, if the vCenter Server is not self-managed the workflow will prompt you for the managing vCenter Servers credential.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>VMworld 2019 - Sessions and Events</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2019/06/18/vmworld-2019-sessions-and-events/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2019/06/18/vmworld-2019-sessions-and-events/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;VMworld US 2019 is just around the corner and the session acceptance emails have just been sent out.

&lt;h1 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using tools such as &lt;a href="https://www.getpostman.com/"&gt;Postman&lt;/a&gt; can make it utilizing API&amp;rsquo;s a bit easier, but you still need to be familiar with a separate tool or UI. I was able to develop my own version and build my first Powershell Module that you can use to patch the VCSA in a simple method. Some of the function names below may not be 100% exact and this is due to the accepted verbs for Powershell. If you have further recommendations I would be happy to entertain changing the Powershell verbage.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Patching the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) using the REST API - Part 1 (Postman Collection)</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2018/12/20/patching-the-vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa-using-the-rest-api/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2018/12/20/patching-the-vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa-using-the-rest-api/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I am a huge fan of Automating the vSphere Lifecycle process.

Please make sure prior to upgrading your VDS to 6.6 all ESXi hosts have been upgraded to ESXi 6.7, if you still have hosts on ESXi 6.5 you will only be able to upgrade to version 6.5.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Automating Migration of VMFS-5 to VMFS-6 Datastores</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2018/10/07/automating-migration-of-vmfs-5-to-vmfs-6-datastores/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Oct 2018 08:13:29 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2018/10/07/automating-migration-of-vmfs-5-to-vmfs-6-datastores/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Next up in our Automating your vSphere Upgrade blog series is your VMFS Datastore. vSphere 6.5 and vSphere 6.7 both support the latest VMFS-6.

I am a huge fan of these as they make migrations and upgrades seamless&amp;ndash;especially when having to perform the task if you have multiple PSC&amp;rsquo;s and vCenter Servers.

I am here to talk to you about planning your vSphere upgrade and some planning and considerations you should have when going to the latest release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first, thing I would like to mention is there is no supported migration from vSphere 5.x to 6.7.

&lt;p&gt;This is my sixth year as a vExpert (2013,2014,2015,2016,2017 and 2018). It has been great to see the community grow and the amount of vExperts increase. Now that my new role will have me travelling and presenting more, I look forward to meeting up with many new and existing vExperts this year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had set a personal goal at the beginning of the year, that I would pass the VCAP6-DCV Design and unfortunately after months of studying I took it and failed in March. I was ready to give up based on the cost of the exam and the time i spent studying. However, I found out recently that a new version based on 6.5 was released in August and the Visio like design sections were dropped (which were the biggest pain), so I worked to acquire a voucher from work and decided on 3 days ago since I had some downtime at work I would go for it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>My New Desk by StandDesk</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2017/08/24/my-new-desk-by-standdesk/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Aug 2017 16:33:29 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2017/08/24/my-new-desk-by-standdesk/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I have been looking for a new desk for awhile.

&lt;p&gt;My question today was how do I pre-create a computer AD account, join a device to the domain and then clean it up when the machine is destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

This is an incremental update a lot of people wait for before upgrading from a previous version. I have been lucky to have been running on vSphere 6.5 for quite some time and have been enjoying it very much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously we never upgrade production first, if we can help it. I decided to attempt an upgrade on one of our QA vCenters that was deployed using the VCHA Advanced workflow. I followed my standard upgrade steps &lt;a href="https://davidstamen.com/vmware/vsphere-65-updating-appliance-configured-with-vcenter-ha/"&gt;Updating a VCHA 6.5 vCenter&lt;/a&gt; however when I went to failover the Active node to the upgraded passive/witness nodes, services would not start, I then noticed that the hostnames had reset to localhost.localdom which is kind of a big issue as vCenter relies on the hostname being set.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Another New Blog Platform</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2017/07/31/another-new-blog-platform/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Jul 2017 16:51:28 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2017/07/31/another-new-blog-platform/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="another-new-blog-platform"&gt;Another New Blog Platform!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it seems there is a bit of battle between the Jekll/Hugo/Ghost platforms. I have been trying to be a little more flexible with Jekyll and it was giving me issues, so I decided to switch to Hugo.

I reached out to Kyle Ruddy and he informed me there is an API to do this, and that started my adventure to get this working.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Configuring Unifi Controller and USG for L2TP VPN</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2017/04/25/configuring-unifi-controller-and-usg-for-l2tp-vpn/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2017/04/25/configuring-unifi-controller-and-usg-for-l2tp-vpn/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I have been waiting for native GUI support for L2TP vpn with local users and it is finally here!

&lt;p&gt;I have been working on a Migration from PowerDNS using a MySQL DB. We have a custom solution which gets updated and gets pushed to Akamai. The problem is, this custom solution requires all the zones to be in bind format. Doing some research I found out there is no easy way to get these zones into a bind zone file. You could setup a secondary server and do zone transfers, but that wouldnt meet my requirements.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Functional Branding of vSphere Web Client Logon Page</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2017/01/19/functional-branding-of-vsphere-web-client-logon-page/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2017/01/19/functional-branding-of-vsphere-web-client-logon-page/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I had a use case I wanted to investigate in regards to the new VCHA that is part of VMware vCenter Server 6.5. One thing I noticed, is when you have VCHA configured, there is no way to know which node of the HA cluster you are connecting to without being logged on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever I would move the VM to our new DC, it would fail to boot properly. It would boot straight to Windows Recovery. If I moved the same VM to any other type of storage(NFS, iSCSI, Local) the VM would boot perfectly fine.

&lt;p&gt;This process is very straight forward. We will begin with updating our Platform Service Controllers (PSC) and then proceed with the vCenter Appliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSH to your Primary PSC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are currently in the bash shell, type appliancesh to switch shells to run the update.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run software-packages install &amp;ndash;url &amp;ndash;acceptEulas to download and install the packages from the VMware Repo.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can use the &amp;ndash;ISO switch or supply a custom url as well if needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sit back and wait. Once it is finished you will be prompted to reboot.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reboot by typing shutdown reboot /r reason&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Associate a stakeholder with the information that needs to be collected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Utilize inventory and assessment data from a current environment to define a baseline state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyze customer interview data to explicitly define customer #### Objectives for a conceptual design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine customer priorities for defined #### Objectives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure that Availability, Manageability, Performance, Recoverability and Security (AMPRS) considerations are applied during the requirements gathering process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given results of the requirements gathering process, identify requirements for a conceptual design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Categorize requirements by infrastructure qualities to prepare for logical design requirements.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to run these updates on over 50 hosts and I really didn&amp;rsquo;t want to have to ssh and install it manually.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a heads up. If you are doing this on ESXi 6.0.. don&amp;rsquo;t. It can cause an issue with the proxy DVS having different ID than the actual DVS causing my original issue, still working with VMware Support to find out more details.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After &amp;ldquo;Restoring Network Configuration&amp;rdquo; a few too many times, I finally realized I could just add the uplinks back via CLI until support can figure out why this is occurring, here are the details on how to manage the uplinks on a DVS via CLI.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Configuring Multiple UCS VLAN's</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2015/11/23/configuring-multiple-ucs-vlans/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2015/11/23/configuring-multiple-ucs-vlans/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We are currently working on some Cisco ACI Integration and wanted to add a large VLAN Pool to a UCS Configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An example of a propagated permission:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most inventory objects inherit permissions from a single parent object in the hierarchy. For example, a datastore inherits permissions from either its parent datastore folder or parent data center. Virtual machines inherit permissions from both the parent virtual machine folder and the parent host, cluster, or resource pool simultaneously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;An example of an explicit permission:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User1 is assigned Permission to only see and modify VM1&lt;/li&gt;

The problem is when I went to redeploy it I got the following error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://davidstamen.com/images/unregistervcsaerror.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decoding the error, I pretty much figured that the object already existed in the SSO database and I needed to delete the existing object. Here is how you do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log in as root to the appliance shell of the Platform Services Controller appliance with which the vCenter Server Appliance is registered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To enable the Bash shell, run the shell.set &amp;ndash;enabled true command.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run the shell command to start the Bash shell and log in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run the cmsso-util unregister command to unregister the powered off vCenter Server Appliance.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cmsso-util unregister &amp;ndash;node-pnid vCenter-FQDNorIP &amp;ndash;username administrator@your_domain_name &amp;ndash;passwd vCenter-Single-Sign-On-password&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code is also fairly simple, it pulls in data from a few .CSV files and deploy&amp;rsquo;s the servers, installs the roles, creates the scopes, creates MAC Address allow policies and then creates a couple reservations.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Indexing your Horizon View Database</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2015/09/30/indexing-your-horizon-view-database/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2015/09/30/indexing-your-horizon-view-database/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I am currently troubleshooting some issues with the Horizon event database having some performance issues.

&lt;p&gt;By Default the view event database is not indexed.

Previously it was only supported on a limited set of older operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally when we deployed we had deployed Ubuntu 12.04, however now the newer kernel 14.04 is supported so I will show you how to upgrade your desktop to the latest version and now use the new agent as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you followed my [previous]({{ site.url }}/horizon%20view/horizon-view-block-linux-vdi-console-access/) post to disable Console access. Go ahead and shutdown the desktop and change it back to &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; to enable console, or you can do this all via &lt;strong&gt;SSH&lt;/strong&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Upgrading vRealize Operations Horizon Adapter to 6.1</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2015/09/22/upgrading-vrealize-operations-horizon-adapter-to-61/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2015/09/22/upgrading-vrealize-operations-horizon-adapter-to-61/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;vRealize Operations 6.1 is now available, I thought I would put a quick guide together as I go through the upgrade process.

&lt;p&gt;To upgrade from vRealize Operations Manager to the most recent version, follow these steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.vmware.com/group/vmware/details?productId=538&amp;amp;downloadGroup=VROPS-610"&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt; the PAK file(s) needed based on the type of cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vApp clusters
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The vApp cluster requires the deployment of the OS upgrade and the product upgrade .pak files.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For an OS upgrade, the file is: vRealize_Operations_Manager-VA-OS-xxx.pak&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the product upgrade of vApp clusters, the file is: vRealize_Operations_Manager-VA-xxx.pak&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vApp heterogeneous clusters
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The vApp heterogeneous cluster requires the deployment of the OS upgrade and the product upgrade .pak files.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For an OS upgrade, the file is: vRealize_Operations_Manager-VA-OS-xxx.pak&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the product upgrade of a heterogeneous cluster that has VA nodes with Windows Remote Collectors, the file is: vRealize_Operations_Manager-VA-WIN-xxx.pak&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RHEL standalone clusters
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The RHEL standalone cluster requires the deployment of only the product upgrade .pak file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the product upgrade of RHEL clusters, the file is: vRealize_Operations_Manager-RHEL-xxx.pak&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RHEL heterogeneous clusters
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The RHEL heterogeneous cluster requires the deployment of only the product upgrade .pak file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the product upgrade of a heterogeneous cluster that has RHEL nodes with Windows Remote Collectors, the file is: vRealize_Operations_Manager-RHEL-WIN-xxx.pak&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Windows clusters
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Windows cluster requires the deployment of only the product upgrade .pak file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the product upgrade of Windows clusters, the file is: vRealize_Operations_Manager-WIN-xxx.pak&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the upgrade process is pretty straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Unable to join PSC to Domain via Webclient</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2015/09/21/unable-to-join-psc-to-domain-via-webclient/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2015/09/21/unable-to-join-psc-to-domain-via-webclient/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I am actually pretty surprised this bug still exists. I came across this issue with my first deployment of vSphere 6. Now I am circling back around to do a POC and it still exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When trying to join a Platform Services Controller to the domain via the vSphere Webclient I get the following error: &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;java.lang.reflect.invocationTargetException&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://davidstamen.com/images/pscdomainerror.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are currently two workarounds now with 6.0U1 I am aware of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first method is to join to the domain using the CLI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;/opt/likewise/bin/domainjoin-cli join domain username
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second method is to use the new PSC interface to join to the domain.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigate to &lt;strong&gt;https://fqdnofpsc/psc&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select &lt;strong&gt;Appliance Settings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on &lt;strong&gt;Manage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under &lt;strong&gt;Active Directory&lt;/strong&gt; Select Join and enter in your details&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

As always VMware has made this very easy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First download the bits from &lt;a href="https://my.vmware.com/group/vmware/info/slug/desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_horizon_6/6_2"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upgrade documentation can also be found &lt;a href="https://pubs.vmware.com/horizon-62-view/topic/com.vmware.ICbase/PDF/view-62-upgrades.pdf"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning:&lt;/strong&gt; In my environment I do not have a composer server, if you had one this would be upgraded first
The upgrade order is as follows. Composer Server, Connection Servers and then Security Servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log on to your connection server and launch the executable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This script can be extremely handy as it will take care of extending the VMDK and then going to the OS and then performing the expansion there as well. This has been helpful when needing to extend a large batch of servers (60+).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Syntax:&lt;/strong&gt; .\ExtendVMDKandGuest VMNAME&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had to remove a LUN from a cluster and thought &amp;ldquo;Do I really need to detach all the LUN&amp;rsquo;s, before un-mapping from my SAN?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unmount Datastore&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detach LUN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Un-map from SAN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rescan Cluster&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well here is a handy script with output. All you need to do is unmount your datastore(s), and then enter in your naaid of your LUN&amp;rsquo;s and the cluster you want to remove it from, save it an execute. All the LUN&amp;rsquo;s will be detached without having to manually go and detach it from every LUN in your cluster.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>vSphere 6.0 Update 1 Released</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2015/09/10/vsphere-60-update-1-released/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2015/09/10/vsphere-60-update-1-released/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Today vSphere 6.0 U1 is released.

I decided I would run it on Ubuntu Server using NGINX as the web platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a quick vagrant runbook that will quickly get a linux server deployed and install NGINX to host your website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code can be found &lt;a href="https://github.com/dstamen/Vagrant/tree/master/jekyll-nginx"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bootstrap_linux_nginx.sh file runs the following commands to install NGINX.

However as most of us have seen, when a user is logged onto the guest the screen is shown in the console. In some organizations this may pose a privacy or security risk.&lt;/p&gt;

The process is pretty straightforward, however I came across one hiccup I wanted to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am assuming you have already upgraded your View Composer, Connection and Security Servers and are now focused on getting the agents up to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install/Update Agents on virtual desktops to 6.1.1 &lt;strong&gt;(The HTML Access 3.4 client will not work with previous agent versions)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install/Update Agents on RDS servers to 6.1.1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install the HTML Access 3.4 to all your connection servers within the appropriate enviroment if load balanced&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now you can logon to your HTML Client and look for your published apps&amp;hellip;.however you will see that they are missing&amp;hellip;.looking into the actual guide for the html access there is an additional step.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vmware.com/pdf/horizon-view/horizon-html-access-3x-document.pdf"&gt;HTML Access Guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start="5"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log on to a connection server running 6.1.1 (If you are in a mixed enviroment this change cannot be made on a previous version.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigate to Farms and then edit each RDS farm to enable HTML Access.
&lt;img src="https://davidstamen.com/images/Screen-Shot-2015-06-10-at-10.53.53-AM.png#center" alt=""&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Voila you now have access to all your applications via the HTML client with a fancy new interface!

&lt;h1 id="initial-thoughts"&gt;Initial Thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I sat and took the VCP6-DCV Delta Exam beta. I have never taken a VMware beta exam so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite sure what to expect, from what I have been told, I expected lots of questions with bad grammar and horrible spelling. However today I got something a bit different. Ill explain it best without violating any NDA.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>vSphere6 - Unable to use session credentials</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2015/04/13/vsphere6-unable-to-use-session-credentials/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Apr 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2015/04/13/vsphere6-unable-to-use-session-credentials/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;So one thing I have come across with a few VCSA6 installs was the inability to use login with current credentials via the Web client or vSphere client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with VMware support we were finally able to get it working with a few tweaks and there is a current pending KB that has not been published yet. (KB2113038) I have been told this affects both an embedded deployment (VCSA and PSC together) and external deployment (VCSA and PSC seperate.)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>PowerCLI - Extend VMDK and Guest OS</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2015/04/02/powercli-extend-vmdk-and-guest-os/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Apr 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2015/04/02/powercli-extend-vmdk-and-guest-os/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;So as always things change across multiple Window&amp;rsquo;s operating systems and VMware revisions. I had a need to extend the drives on about 50 VMs today and really didn&amp;rsquo;t want to do all that clicking. I remember awhile back it was easy to do this with a Basic Set-Harddisk and use the -ResizeGuestPartition but alas that has been removed from the current functionality. So I took my search to google and found a couple scripts that worked ok, but nothing that was a seamless experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>VCP6-DCV Beta Exam</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2015/04/01/vcp6-dcv-beta-exam/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Apr 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2015/04/01/vcp6-dcv-beta-exam/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;VMware has announced &lt;a href="https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/plan.cfm?plan=64178&amp;amp;ui=www_cert"&gt;https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/plan.cfm?plan=64178&amp;amp;ui=www_cert&lt;/a&gt; the availability of the VCP6-DCV beta exams. The beta exam includes 3 seperate exams. If you are currently an active VCP you can either take the VCP6-DCV or VCP6-DCV Delta exam, and if you are currently not certified you are required to take the vSphere 6 Foundations and VCP6-DCV to obtain the certification.&lt;/p&gt;

Everytime i entered in the user name and password, I would receive the following error. &lt;strong&gt;FAILED (Format of the initialization string does not conform to specification starting at index 88.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://davidstamen.com/images/vROeventdb.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a password issue as I was able to logon to SQL Manager with no issue, and the Horizon View EventsDB was working fine, so I went on a google search to try to hunt through logs. SQL Server was reporting i was entering the wrong password which made me think.

However a coworker of mine was trying to run it, and the script would only return data from the 2nd vCenter we were connecting to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing some troubleshooting we noticed their DefaultVIServerMode was set to single. This means that only a single servers connection will occur at once. Changing this setting is very easy, there are 3 scopes, but only one really needs to be set.

Upon further research I have identified a good step by step to replace the trend micro DSM certificate and include subject alternative names using a Microsoft certificate authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stop the “Trend Micro Deep Security Manager” service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If not already created, create a folder on the root of C:\ called “certs”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to C:\Program Files\Trend Micro\Deep Security Manager and create a new folder called “Backupkeystore”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy .keystore and configuration.properties to Backupkeystore folder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open administrative command line &amp;amp; change directory to “C:\Program Files \Trend Mirco\Deep Security Manager\jre\bin\”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run this command “keytool -genkey -alias tomcat -keyalg RSA -dname cn=(FQDN of Server)”.
This will create a “.keystore” file under the C:\Users\ directory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When prompted for password enter a password for the keystore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run this command “keytool -certreq -keyalg RSA -alias tomcat -file certrequest.txt”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When prompted for password use same password as entered in step 6.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the certrequest.txt located in C:\Program Files \Trend Micro\Deep Security Manager\jre\bin\ and copy the contents of the file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access the CA server site &lt;a href="https://certsrv"&gt;https://certsrv&lt;/a&gt; and click “Request a certificate”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select “advanced certificate request”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select “Submit a certificate request by using a base-64-encoded CMC or PKCS #10 file, or submit a renewal request by using a base-64-encoded PKCS #7 file”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paste copied text from certrequest.txt in “Base-64-encoded certificate request” field, select “Web Server” under Certificate Template and enter Subject Alternative Names under Additional Attributes using the following format: “san:dns=&amp;amp;dns=” and click “Submit.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click “Download certificate chain” and save as “trend.p7b” in the certs folder on the C: drive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From administrative command prompt run this command “keytool -import -trustcacerts -alias tomcat -file C:\certs\trend.p7b -keystore C:\Users\.keystore”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When prompted for password use same password as entered in step 6.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When prompted to “Install reply anyway”, type “yes”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy .keystore from C:\Users%username%\ and paste it into C:\Program Files \Trend Micro\Deep Security Manager&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From administrative command prompt change directories to C:\Program Files \Trend Micro\Deep Security Manager and run this command “.\configuration.properties”. This will open the configuration.properties in notepad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look for the line keystorePass= and delete the entry after the = symbol, enter the password used in step 6 after the = and save and close the file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restart the “Trend Micro Deep Security Manager” service&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download the Chrome Policy Plugin &lt;a href="http://dl.google.com/dl/edgedl/chrome/policy/policy_templates.zip"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the zip file you just downloaded and locate the .ADM file that best matches your system:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extract the .ADM file to any folder on your hard drive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to Start &amp;gt; Run, and run gpedit.msc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-click Local Computer Policy &amp;gt; Computer Configuration &amp;gt; Administrative Templates, and select Add/Remove Templates:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the adm template that you saved to disk earlier:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should now see the template underneath a Google &amp;gt; Google Chrome section within Administrative Templates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Depending on which operating system you have, it might be under a Classic Administrative Templates (ADM) folder:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start="6"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on Google Chrome in the left-hand pane and then double-click on the item called Enable deprecated web platform features in the list within the right-hand pane:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NOTE: It helps to sort the table in the right-hand pane by the Setting column in order to find the Enable deprecated web platform features item more easily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start="7"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the new screen that appears, click the Enabled radio button:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Options section of the same screen, click the Show… button&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Please make sure you have at least 20GB for repo, 10GB for var, and 1GB for root partition.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://davidstamen.com/images/vdpa-diskspace1.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon further research there seems to be an issue from 5.5.1 and 5.5.5 appliances with the /space partition filling up due to PostGres events. The issue can be resolving by installing the following VDP patch (vdp_patch-5.5.5.190.)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Unable to Install .NET 3.5 on Server 2012R2</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2014/09/11/unable-to-install-net-3-5-on-server-2012r2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2014/09/11/unable-to-install-net-3-5-on-server-2012r2/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;So upon trying to install .Net 3.5 on a new server today it would not allow me to, it kept telling me the source files were unavailable even after pointing to source directly to multiple ISO&amp;rsquo;s and copied the files locally.&lt;/p&gt;

Reviewing the customization logs(C:\windows\temp\vmware-imc\guestcust.log) I noticed the following error..Unable to set customization status in vmx.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon further research it seems this is a known issue and is resolved in ESXi 5.1 Express Patch 5 &lt;a href="http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/search.do?cmd=displayKC&amp;amp;docType=kc&amp;amp;docTypeID=DT_KB_1_1&amp;amp;externalId=2077640"&gt;KB2077640&lt;/a&gt; as referenced in this article &lt;a href="http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&amp;amp;cmd=displayKC&amp;amp;externalId=2078352"&gt;KB2078352&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However the hotfix only fixes future occurences, you still need to fix all the VMs affected. See below for the powercli script I created to connect to all my vcenters, get VM&amp;rsquo;s that are affected and then fix them. Please note as this is not referenced in the KB that the VM will need to be POWERED OFF and then POWERED ON for the change to go into affect. A restart will not fix it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Configuring ESXi 5.5 Dump Collector</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2014/06/10/configuring-esxi-5-5-dump-collector/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2014/06/10/configuring-esxi-5-5-dump-collector/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone who listened to me on the EMEA vBrownbag.

If you have multiple RDM&amp;rsquo;s on a VM and need to get the NAA_ID for them the below PowerCLI command will get you that information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;Get-VM VMNAME| Get-HardDisk -DiskType &amp;#34;RawPhysical&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;RawVirtual&amp;#34; | Select Parent,Name,DiskType,ScsiCanonicalName,DeviceName,CapacityGB | fl
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://davidstamen.com/images/naaid.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you then need to match the SCSI virtual disk to the Guest OS this is a great article on how to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

To protect yourselves against this I would recommend setting up a transport rule to drop or reject any email with executable content. This can be done for Exchange 2013 or Office365 (Exchange Online).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Enable SSH on vSphere Management Assistant 5.0</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2014/05/01/enable-ssh-on-vma-5-0/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2014/05/01/enable-ssh-on-vma-5-0/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;While continuing to build out my lab for VCAP-DCA today I had to deploy the vMA (vSphere Management Assistant).

Upon further research, I noticed that &amp;ldquo;Native VLAN&amp;rdquo; was not selected. This is a must for any operating system that does not do VLAN Tagging such as ESXi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So remember to set the VLAN to Native if using an operating system that does not support VLAN tagging!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Nested ESXi and NFS</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2014/04/29/nested-esxi-and-nfs/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2014/04/29/nested-esxi-and-nfs/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I was working today on configuring NFS/Openfiler in my lab and came across an issue that my nested ESXi host&amp;rsquo;s couldn&amp;rsquo;t talk over the VSS (Standard Switch) I created. Upon further research when using nested ESXi you need to enable &amp;ldquo;Promiscuous Mode&amp;rdquo; on the VSS to allow the traffic to pass.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Search</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/search/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/search/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
