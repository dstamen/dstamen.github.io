The answer is yes! With all of the integrations with automation platformsm, Pure Storage Arrays have many options. This blog will cover how to handle this with the VMware Event Broker Appliance (VEBA)!\nEver since I first heard about VEBA it really interested me. William Lam and Michael Gasch presented on it at VMworld 2019. Many things have gotten in the way, but I finally had time to sit down and look at how to deploy and use VEBA.\nIntroduction Before I cover why we may get asked how to automatically expand a volume, I want to cover one thing I love about Pure Storage FlashArray. The array itself has no per-volume performance limits. This means that if a customer wants to deploy a single large datastore or many small datastores it is really up to them. In some cases, customers have datastores carved up for certain roles\u0026rsquo;s such as Snapshots or Replication. In this case, if a datastore gets full they just want to be able to easily expand it. Currently when customers ask if this can be done, we point them over to Cody Hostermans blog. This configuration still works, but its back from 2016 and its SNMP (yuck) sorry Cody.\nDeployment of VEBA Since VEBA is a pre-built OVA appliance, deployment is extremely simple. It is still a VMware Fling but has quite the community behind it. When you deploy the OVA to your vCenter Server you have the choice on whether you wish to use OpenFaaS or AWS Event Bridge as the event broker. For my example I am using OpenFaas.\n You can learn more about the deployment with OpenFaas or AWS EventBridge within their documentation pages.\n     Implementing the VEBA Function Luckily there is a great community for VEBA, and it was useful for me getting up and running. There are prebuilt functions and a great #vmware-event-broker-appliance channel on vmwarecode.slack.com. For this particular use case an example already existed for datastore usage that I was able to build upon.\nA few things I learned along the way\u0026hellip;\nCreate your own image in DockerHub or in Harbor First  Docker must be installed previous to implementing functions.\n To begin, head over to hub.docker.com and create a repository for your function. Once you have it created you should have a place to store your image such as username/repository, in my case it is dstamen/vebapowercli-increaseds-pure\nSince this particular image requires PowerCLI and Powershell it will use the vmware/powerclicore:latest base image.\nUsing docker pull it down to your local machine.\n1docker pull vmware/powerclicore:latest Once it has been pulled down use docker images to see the image information.\n1docker images|grep vmware/powerclicore We will now need to tag and push the image to our own repository to use as a base image. For the tag identifier use the Image ID from docker images.\n1docker tag a0fceeaed43e dstamen/test 2docker push dstamen/test Now that our image is ready, we can proceed to configuring the function for VEBA.\nConfigure the VEBA Function Next, we will need to update the function files for your environment. Grab a copy of the VEBA function from GitHub.\n    There are 3 main files we will need to look at.\n stack.yml vc-ds-config.json /handler/script.ps1  stack.yml In my experience, the stack.yml is similar to a kubernetes manifest where it specifies the details for the function to run. You will need to update this file to include the following parameters:\n Gateway: This will be the FQDN or IP of your VEBA server. Function Name: This will be the name of the function defined in OpenFaas. Image: This will be the username/repository you pushed your image to in the previous step.   vc-ds-config.json This file is the secrets file that stores your configuration such as passwords and data secrely. As I am also including a Slack notification there is a few extra fields.\n SLACK_URL: This is the webhook URL you will setup as part of a slack integration. SLACK_CHANNEL: This will be the channel you wish for the slack messages to be posted to. SUBJECT: This will be the title of the slack notifications. VC: This is the FQDN of the vCenter Server where the function is to be ran against. VC_USERNAME: This is the username of a user that has rights to expand the datastore in the vCenter Server. VC_PASSWORD: This is the password for the above user. VC_ALARM_NAME: This is the alarm name for this function, do not change unless you have created a custom alarm. DATASTORE_NAMES: This is an array of datastore names for the function to trigger against. If the datastore is not in this list, it will not be automatically expanded. PURE_USERNAME: This is a user that has access to expand the volume on the FlashArray. PURE_PASSWORD: This is the password for the above user.   /handler/script.ps1 This is the core script that is executed for the function. As this runs as a container, whatever is done must be run in Powershell Core. The script entails parsing the event when it comes in to make sure the datastore exists in the secrets file, and then based on threshold will expand the disk by that capacity. For my lab if the threshold reached warning I expanded by 10GB. If the threshold reached error I expanded by 20GB, this can be easily customized in the script for what works for your environment.\nThe script will only need to be modified to include the connection endpoints of your FlashArray. What the script will do is connect to those flasharrays and find the FlashArray the datastore volume resides on, expand it and then expand the datastore. Once complete it sends a notification to the slack channel.\n     Currently the Pure Storage PowershellSDK does not support PowershellCore. An update is coming, and when it is available I will update this post, with a much shorter script. For the time being I have added functions to the script that will allow this script to run in Powershell Core with no issues. Please see the GitHub repository for the file with the included functions.\n  Once the files are configured we can now push the function to the OpenFaas Gateway.\nDeploying the function to OpenFaas Gateway  Pre-requisite: You will need to install faas-cli\n Initially, this was one of the components I was having the most issues with, until someone mentioned a great shortcut!\nLogin to the OpenFaaS gateway on VMware Event Broker Appliance\n1VEBA_GATEWAY=https://veba.lab.local 2export OPENFAAS_URL=${VEBA_GATEWAY} 3 4faas-cli login --username admin --password-stdin --tls-no-verify Create function secret (only required once)\n1faas-cli secret create vc-slack-config --from-file=vc-slack-config.json --tls-no-verify The Hard Way 1faas-cli build -f stack.yml 2faas-cli push -f stack.yml 3faas-cli deploy -f stack.yml --tls-no-verify The Easy Way 1faas-cli up --tls-no-verify Validating the Deployment After the deploy is complete, you can see the status. faas-cli up will build the image based on the files provided, pushing the script into a docker image. It will then push the image to your dockerhub repository. It will then push the function to your OpenFaas server where it will pull down your docker image and run the function.\n    Troubleshooting the Deployment If at any time you experience issues with your function, there are two ways to see what is going on.\nOption 1 You can use faas-cli to review the logs, however this will only look at the past 30 seconds and will end when the request finishes.\n1faas-cli logs veba-powercli-increaseds-pure --tls-no-verify Option 2 The preferred option is to tail the logs on the VEBA appliance itself. Since the function runs as a k8s container, there is a couple steps to view the logs.\n1 2ssh root@veba.fqdn #ssh to veba server 3kubectl get pods -n openfaas-fn ##get k8s pods in the openfaas-fn namespace 4kubectl logs veba-powercli-increaseds-pure-59db6cd7f9-g4p4r -n openfaas-fn #review the pod logs. this will be regenerated on each deployment of your function      Conclusion One thing I love about the Pure Storage FlashArray is the suite of integrations we have with different automation providers. This was just one great example how this could be accomplished with Powershell, PowerCLI and VEBA.\nWhat would you like to see next?

This command can be used to get status of staged update, install update or any other update status.\nExample:\n     Remove-VCSAUpdate Remove-VCSAUpdate is the command you will use when you wish to remove a staged update.\nExample:\n     Start-VCSAUpdateInstall Start-VCSAUpdateInstall is the command you will use when you wish to install a currently staged update. If no update is staged you must use Start-VCSAUpdateStageandInstall\nExample:\n     Start-VCSAUpdatePrecheck Start-VCSAUpdatePrecheck is the command you will use when you wish to run the built-in update Precheck.\nExample:\n     Start-VCSAUpdateStageandInstall Start-VCSAUpdateInstall is the command you will use when you wish to install and stage an update.\nExample:\n     Start-VCSAUpdateValidate Start-VCSAUpdateValidate is the command you will use when you wish validate the current update.\nExample:\n     Stop-VCSAUpdate Stop-VCSAUpdate is the command you will use when you want to cancel an update task such as staging an update or other task that has a status of cancelable.\nExample:\n     Putting the Powershell Module to Use This Examples assumes your VCSA has Internet Access and we will update via the Online Repo. You can access the Powershell Module here on the Powershell Gallery.\n Important Note: The code samples included in this module are not supported by VMware. The code included is only provided as sample code for the purpose of demonstrating different tasks using the PowerCLI and the REST API.\n  Conclusion I hope this module can be useful for you to get started with updating your VCSA in a more Automated fashion.\nIf you have any questions feel free to reach out here or on twitter @davidstamen\n","permalink":"https://davidstamen.com/2020/06/22/updating-the-vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa-with-powercli-revisited/","tags":["PowerCLI","vSphere 6.7","REST API","vCenter Server","vSphere 7.0","Powershell","vSphere"],"title":"Updating the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) with PowerCLI - Revisited"},{"categories":["VMware","Pure Storage"],"contents":"The more I play with our integrations the more I am impressed.

Let\u0026rsquo;s dive into this post to see how I completed the upgrade of my vSphere with Kubernetes environment.\nPre-Requisties  Before we jump in, its always a great idea to review the release notes and the Updating vSphere with Kubernetes Clusters documentation.\n The order to upgrade components would be:\n Upgrade NSX-T Data Center. Upgrade vCenter Server. Upgrade ESXi hosts. Perform a Supervisor Namespaces update (including Kubernetes upgrade).  The procedure to update a Supervisor Namespace is pretty straight forward:\n Navigate to Menu -\u0026gt; Workload Management Navigate to Namespaces -\u0026gt; Updates Select the Version that you want to update to. Select one or more Supervisor Clusters to apply the update to. Click Apply Updates.  The Update Process  In order to perform an update your Configuration Status must be Running and Kubernetes Status must Ready. If they are not in these states your cluster will not be eligible to update.\n If we head over to our Cluster -\u0026gt; Monitor -\u0026gt; Namespaces Overview we can check the status of our cluster.\n    From the Available Versions you can choose which version of Kubernetes you wish to update to from the available list.\nSelect the Cluster and Click Apply Updates\n    Now we can monitor the Update Process.\n Did you ever wonder why the Supervisor Cluster IP Pool is 5 IPs? Well the extra one is to for an additional Supervisor Control Plane VM as they are updated one at a time.\n     During the Update Process you can monitor the status by viewing the Recent Tasks or by tailing the /var/log/vmware/wcp/wcpsvc.log on the vCenter Server.\n    Once the Update Process is complete, you will see the updated Version in your **Cluster Namespaces Overview.\n    Troubleshooting During my update I had to do some troubleshooting, possibly due to self-inflicted unsupportiveness. This particular environment is nested and may not have all the resources allocated that were needed. During my update process it could not validate the last node was up and running as it could not connect to port 6443. I could communicate with each node individually, but not the Supervisor Load Balancer. Looking at the logs I could see connection refused.\n    If I looked at the UI, i could also see that the VMs were angry as they had extremely high CPU Usage and were somewhat unresponsive.\n    As these VM\u0026rsquo;s are managed by vSphere with Kubernetes there is no way to Manage them through the vSphere Client to reset/poweroff. I tried to just go in and execute a reboot from the VM but that did not work either.\nTo get my cluster to finish the update I had to go to the ESXi Hosts and use ESXCLI to forcibly kill the VM\u0026rsquo;s to PowerOff and then have vSphere with Kubernetes Power them Back on.\nThose instructions are located here.\nConclusion The update process for a vSphere with Kubernetes Cluster is quite simple, hopefully this has helped understand the process.

Let\u0026rsquo;s look at what was fixed.\nThe Release Notes  4.3.1 Release Notes for the Pure Storage vSphere Client Plugin\n General Version 4.3.1 of the Pure Storage vSphere HTML Client Plugin supports vSphere (vCenter and ESXi) version 6.5 and later and Purity version 4.10 and later. Users can upgrade to this version of the plugin from previous release version 4.x or higher. This version is certified by VMware.\nWhat’s New  For the volume group manager, you can now filter by datastore name, not just volume or volume group name.  Fixed issues  Errors in datastore provisioning wizard around loading FlashArray list, matching host groups, or creating the datastore, such as String index out of range:  This was due to introduced code for NVMe-oF based datastores that caused lookups to fail if the type was unknown. This is fixed. Any customer experiencing generic \u0026ldquo;could not lookup object errors\u0026rdquo; should upgrade to this release. Multiple pathologies relate to this issue.   The LUN ID was shown in the NVMe-oF datastore view, not the NVMe namespace ID. The namespace ID is now correctly shown.

In previous blogs I covered how you could deploy a TKG to VMware Cloud on AWS as well as to a regular vSphere Environment. Today we will demonstrate how to use the TKG CLI to provision a Tanzu Kubernetes Cluster (TKC) to a vSphere With Kubernetes Environment.\nIn the previous blogs, we covered TKG on VMC and on vSphere. When you deploy a TKC to a vSphere with Kubernetes Supervisor Cluster there is no need to deploy a TKG Management Cluster as the Supervisor Cluster has the same functionality.\nAdding the Supervisor Cluster as a Management Cluster using the TKG CLI Before we begin, we can validate if the Supervisor Cluster is currently added as a TKG Management Cluster by running:\n1tkg get management-cluster      In our case our output is blank, so we can proceed to add the Supervisor Cluster into the TKG CLI. Using kubectl login to your Supervisor Cluster\n1kubectl vsphere login --vsphere-username Administrator@vsphere.local --server=control_Plane_VIP --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true Switch Context to your Supervisor Cluster\n1kubectl config use-context \u0026lt;Supervisor_Cluster_context\u0026gt; Add your Management Cluster\n1tkg add management-cluster Verify your Management-Cluster has been added.\n1tkg get management-cluster      Deploying a TKC using the TKG CLI Before you can deploy a TKC using the TKG CLI you need to either set environment variables by specifying export = at the command line, or set them by updating the ~/.tkg/config file.\nHere is an example of variables for my environment.\n1export CONTROL_PLANE_STORAGE_CLASS=vsan-default-storage-policy 2export WORKER_STORAGE_CLASS=vsan-default-storage-policy 3export DEFAULT_STORAGE_CLASS=vsan-default-storage-policy 4export STORAGE_CLASSES=vsan-default-storage-policy 5export SERVICE_DOMAIN=fsa.lab 6export CONTROL_PLANE_VM_CLASS=best-effort-xsmall 7export WORKER_VM_CLASS=best-effort-xsmall 8export SERVICE_CIDR=100.64.0.0/13 9export CLUSTER_CIDR=100.96.0.0/11 Once your variables are set you can obtain a list of Kubernetes Versions that are available in the Supervisor Cluster\n1kubectl get virtualmachineimages Identify which Namespace you want to deploy your TKC to:\n1kubectl get namespaces Run tkg create cluster to provision your TKC cluster:\n1tkg create cluster tkg-tkc-01 --plan=dev --namespace tkc01 --kubernetes-version=v1.16.8+vmware.1-tkg.3.60d2ffd      Conclusion Using the TKG CLI to provision Tanzu Kubernetes Clusters is a great way to handle the deployment, if you wish to not use the TKG CLI you can still provision a TKC using kubectl and yaml\nQuestions or Comments?

With the tools we have available during our hackathon it was asked if we could run vVols in VMware Cloud on AWS. Because of the locked down nature of VMC we could not run vVols directly on that cluster, but I did find a way that we could. Dive into this blog post to see how vVols run on CBS.\nIf you are not familiar with Pure Storage Cloud Block Store it is a hosted Pure Storage array in AWS that can function as storage for EC2 instances or even be a replication target for your on-premises FlashArrays.\nDeploying a Nested Lab on VMware Cloud on AWS. William Lam has a great post on Nested ESXi on VMware Cloud on AWS (VMC) which I followed. The steps include the following:  Create a Content Library in VMC subscribed to the Nested ESXi Repo Provision out your Nested ESXi Servers from the templates. Extract your vCenter Server ISO, and deploy the OVA to VMC. Access your VC on port 5480 and finalize the deployment.  Once this was done, I configured my vCenter Server by creating a Cluster, Adding in my Hosts and Enabling the Software iSCSI Adapter.\nDeploying a Pure Storage Cloud Block Store on AWS The Pure Storage Cloud Block Store can be deployed as part of an Application Stack from AWS. The deployment is pretty straight forward and the below video walks you through everything you need to know.   Configuring my Nested Lab to Access the Pure Storage Cloud Block Store on AWS The first thing you will need to do is make sure the your AWS VPC has been added to your VMC environment. In our case we had to make sure to add in a route in AWS to communicate back to our VMC environment.\nNext we will install the Pure Storage vSphere Client Plugin and add our Cloud Block Store Array. Then Click on the Array and Register Storage Provider\n    Now let\u0026rsquo;s login to our Cloud Block Store and head over to Settings -\u0026gt; Network and find out our iSCSI IPs. If you are familiar with the FlashArray or FlashBlade UI the CLoud Block Store UI will be very familiar.\n    Next we will configure iSCSI on our ESXi Hosts. Navigate to the iSCSI Software Adapter -\u0026gt; Dynamic Discovery Targets and add in the iSCSI IPs from the Cloud Block Store. Repeat for each ESXi Host.\n    Make a note of the iSCSI IQN that is set in the iSCSI Software Adapter and Navigate back to the Cloud Block Store UI. Navigate to Storage -\u0026gt; Hosts and Create the Host. Repeat for each additional ESXi Host.\n    Next create a Host Group by navigating to Storage -\u0026gt; Hosts and adding in your ESXi Hosts to the group.\n    Next we will create the Protocol Endpoint so our Lab Environment can communicate with vVols on the Cloud Block Store. Navigate to Storage -\u0026gt; Volumes and select the three dots to Show Protocol Endpoints\n    Click on the 3 dots again to Create Protocol Endpoint and name it pure-protocol-endpoint.\n    Next attach the Pure Protocol Endpoint to your Host Group\n    Now it is time to create our vVol Datastore. Right Click your Cluster select Storage -\u0026gt; New Datastore -\u0026gt; vVol. You should see the vVol Container and see that it is backed by our CBS Array connected to ct0. Click Next and attach it to all hosts in the cluster.\n    Your vVol Datastore is now provisioned. You are now able to provision workloads and storage policies running on CBS inside of a Nested ESXi Cluster running on VMware Cloud on AWS.\nTo sum things up Andrew Miller made a great comment on this.\n.twitter-tweet { font: 14px/1.45 -apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,\"Segoe UI\",Roboto,Oxygen-Sans,Ubuntu,Cantarell,\"Helvetica Neue\",sans-serif; border-left: 4px solid #2b7bb9; padding-left: 1.5em; color: #555; } .twitter-tweet a { color: #2b7bb9; text-decoration: none; } blockquote.twitter-tweet a:hover, blockquote.twitter-tweet a:focus { text-decoration: underline; }  Why?\nBecause I can!\n\u0026mdash; Andrew Miller (@andriven) May 13, 2020 Even though this is unsupported, it shows how flexible infrastructure can be. We have essentially virtualized both compute and storage in this lab environment.\nConclusion I feel this was a pretty cool example of the flexibility you have with both the Pure Storage Cloud Block Store and VMware Cloud on AWS. What else will this hackathon bring? You never know!\nQuestions or Comments?

This post will go over how I was able to get TKG deployed on VMC.\nGetting Started In this blog I will cover using the new VMware Fling Demo Appliance for Tanzu Kubernetes Grid if you wish to configure the TKG CLI locally you can review my previous blog.\nThe Demo Appliance for TKG contains everything you need to deploy TKG On-Premises or in the cloud, with or without internet access. It includes all images pre-downloaded as well as the Tanzu CLI\u0026rsquo;s, Harbor, Octant, kubectl and docker.\n    This appliance actually came in handy, as when I was originally trying to deploy TKG on VMC I was having issues pulling down the images.\n.twitter-tweet { font: 14px/1.45 -apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,\"Segoe UI\",Roboto,Oxygen-Sans,Ubuntu,Cantarell,\"Helvetica Neue\",sans-serif; border-left: 4px solid #2b7bb9; padding-left: 1.5em; color: #555; } .twitter-tweet a { color: #2b7bb9; text-decoration: none; } blockquote.twitter-tweet a:hover, blockquote.twitter-tweet a:focus { text-decoration: underline; }  Anyone get #TKG deployed on #VMC? Having issues with the tkg cluster deploying..errors pulling images. /cc @lamw @chipzoller Thoughts?\n\u0026mdash; David Stamen (@davidstamen) May 12, 2020 A few responses later and a chat with William I had the TKG Demo Appliance deployed and deploying TKG and Tanzu Kubernetes Clusters on VMC with ease.\nI will not go over the full details on how to deploy the TKG Demo Appliance, but a great set of instructions are located here.\nConfiguring VMC for TKG  A much more detailed set of instructions can be found as part of the TKG Workshop Guide\n As we start to setup our environment first we will need to create a new network segment in VMC. We will need to first login to the Cloud Console and then navigate to Networking \u0026amp; Security and then to Segments. Click on Add Segment and enter a name, type, gateway/prefix and a DHCP range.\n    Next we we need to configure our firewalls to allow access, by default everything on VMC is set to Deny. Navigate to Networking \u0026amp; Security and then to Groups under Inventory.\nUnder Compute Groups we will create three groups.\n Lab Network (This group will contain the IPs that you wish to connect to the TKG Network. In my cause its home, so i will use my IP from whatismyip.com) SDDC Management (This group will contain the IPs for the SDDC Management Network, by default this is 10.2.0.0/16) TKG Network (this is the segment we created above, 192.168.2.0/24)      Under Management Groups we will create two groups.\n Lab Network (This group will contain the IPs that you wish to connect to the TKG Network. In my cause its home, so i will use my IP from whatismyip.com) TKG Network (this is the segment we created above, 192.168.2.0/24)      Once our groups are created we can configure the VMC Firewall. Navigate to Networking \u0026amp; Security and then to Gateway Firewall under Security.\nUnder Compute Gateway create the following rules.\n Lab Network to TKG Network TKG Network to SDDC Management      Under Management Gateway create the following rules.\n Lab Network to vCenter Server TKG Network to vCenter Server       Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to Publish your changes to active your new firewall rules!\n Next we will need to Request a Public IP and Create a NAT Rule to access our TKG Appliance. Navigate to Networking \u0026amp; Security and then to Public IPs under System. Click on Request New IP and enter in a description for your IP.\n    Navigate to Networking \u0026amp; Security and then to NAT under Network. Click on Add NAT Rule and enter in a name, select your public ip, assign a service and available ports.\n    Once all the networking is configured we can proceed to configure the vCenter Server. We need to import the two templates, this can either by done manually as shown in my previous blog, or you can deploy them from the TKG Demo Content Library\nDeploying TKG on VMC Begin by starting an SSH session to the external IP of your TKG Demo Appliance\n    Create an SSH Keypair. Instructions are located here. Once created you\u0026rsquo;ll need to copy your SSH Public Key from ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n    A sample config.yaml file is located at ~/config.yaml. This will be used to provision our TKG Management Cluster this will need to be filled out for your particular environment. Update the fields to be specific for your environment including the server, password, network, resource pool and folder.\n1VSPHERE_SERVER:\u0026#39;10.2.224.4\u0026#39;2VSPHERE_USERNAME:\u0026#39;cloudadmin@vmc.local\u0026#39;3VSPHERE_PASSWORD:\u0026#39;FILL-ME-IN\u0026#39;4VSPHERE_DATACENTER:\u0026#39;/SDDC-Datacenter\u0026#39;5VSPHERE_DATASTORE:\u0026#39;WorkloadDatastore\u0026#39;6VSPHERE_NETWORK:\u0026#39;david-tkg\u0026#39;7VSPHERE_RESOURCE_POOL:\u0026#39;/SDDC-Datacenter/host/Cluster-1/Resources/Compute-ResourcePool\u0026#39;8VSPHERE_FOLDER:\u0026#39;/SDDC-Datacenter/vm/david\u0026#39;9VSPHERE_TEMPLATE:\u0026#39;photon-3-kube-v1.17.3_vmware.2\u0026#39;10VSPHERE_HAPROXY_TEMPLATE:\u0026#39;photon-3-capv-haproxy-v0.6.3_vmware.1\u0026#39;11VSPHERE_DISK_GIB:3012VSPHERE_NUM_CPUS:213VSPHERE_MEM_MIB:204814VSPHERE_SSH_AUTHORIZED_KEY:\u0026#34;ssh_key\u0026#34;15SERVICE_CIDR:\u0026#34;100.64.0.0/13\u0026#34;16CLUSTER_CIDR:\u0026#34;100.96.0.0/11\u0026#34;17KUBERNETES_VERSION:v1.17.3+vmware.218overridesFolder:/root/.tkg/overrides19providers:20- name:cluster-api21url:/root/.tkg/providers/cluster-api/v0.3.3/core-components.yaml22type:CoreProvider23- name:aws24url:/root/.tkg/providers/infrastructure-aws/v0.5.2/infrastructure-components.yaml25type:InfrastructureProvider26- name:vsphere27url:/root/.tkg/providers/infrastructure-vsphere/v0.6.3/infrastructure-components.yaml28type:InfrastructureProvider29- name:tkg-service-vsphere30url:/root/.tkg/providers/infrastructure-tkg-service-vsphere/v1.0.0/unused.yaml31type:InfrastructureProvider32- name:kubeadm33url:/root/.tkg/providers/bootstrap-kubeadm/v0.3.3/bootstrap-components.yaml34type:BootstrapProvider35- name:kubeadm36url:/root/.tkg/providers/control-plane-kubeadm/v0.3.3/control-plane-components.yaml37type:ControlPlaneProvider38images:39cert-manager:40repository:registry.rainpole.io/library/cert-manager41tag:v0.11.0_vmware.1Save your config file to ~/.tkg/config.yaml\nKick off your Management Cluster deployment by executing tkg init \u0026ndash;infrastructure=vsphere. In about ~5-10 minutes your management cluster should now be provisioned.\n    Now that the TKG Management Cluster is Created. We can use TKG to provision a Tanzu Kubernetes Cluster (TKC). Execute tkg create cluster tkc01 \u0026ndash;plan=dev. After another ~5-10 minutes your TKC cluster should now be provisioned.\n    If we want to access our application externally I recommend using MetalLB as its one of the easier pieces I have found to setup.\nTo install run:\n1kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metallb/metallb/v0.9.3/manifests/namespace.yaml 2kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metallb/metallb/v0.9.3/manifests/metallb.yaml 3# On first install only 4kubectl create secret generic -n metallb-system memberlist --from-literal=secretkey=\u0026#34;$(openssl rand -base64 128)\u0026#34; You will then need to execute a YAML to specify an IP Pool to use.\n1apiVersion:v12kind:ConfigMap3metadata:4namespace:metallb-system5name:config6data:7config:| 8address-pools:9- name:default10protocol:layer211addresses:12- 192.168.2.10- 192.168.2.20Deploy your application, I like to use hipster shop as a demo.\n1kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dstamen/Kubernetes/master/demo-applications/demo-hipstershop.yaml Once deployed find out its External-IP and Port using kubectl get svc.\n    Next, request a new Public IP from VMC and Create a NAT Rule to access our service.\n    If we access our public ip we can see our application running!\n    Conclusion TKG is a very flexible component to get k8s deployed on either your cloud or on-premises VMware environments. Using the TKG Demo Appliance you can be up and running with a TKC Cluster very quickly! This is a great use case for any sort of test/dev/poc.\nQuestions or Comments?

I have done quite a bit with vSphere with Kubernetes and Tanzu Kubernetes Clusters on vSphere with Kubernetes, but something came up and I began to explore native TKG. This blog will cover how to deploy TKG on vSphere and get your management and tkc clusters provisioned.\nAt first I figured I would have some of the same requirements as vSphere with Kubernetes, but as I started going down the path of deploying TKG i kept thinking to myself\u0026hellip; Can it really be this easy? Not only is it easy, it is Free.\nTo begin I first reviewed the TKG Website and TKG Documentation\nBefore we can provison a TKG cluster we must first install Docker and TKG CLI. Instructions to install docker can be found here.\nInstalling the TKG CLI  Go to https://www.vmware.com/go/get-tkg and log in with your My VMware credentials. Head to the Download Section TKG CLI is not currently available for Windows. Download either the Mac OS or Linux CLI Use either the gunzip command or the extraction tool of your choice to unpack the binarie. Run either one of the following commands:  Linux\n1gunzip tkg-linux-amd64-v1.0.0_vmware.1.gz Mac OS\n1gunzip tkg-darwin-amd64-v1.0.0_vmware.1.gz Navigate to the executable for the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid CLI that you downloaded in the previous section. Rename the CLI binary for your platform to tkg, make sure that it is executable, and add it to your PATH.  Linux\n1mv ./tkg-linux-amd64-v1.0.0_vmware.1 /usr/local/bin/tkg Mac OS\n1mv ./tkg-darwin-amd64-v1.0.0_vmware.1 /usr/local/bin/tkg Make the file executable.  1chmod +x /usr/local/bin/tkg Run tkg version to check that the correct version of the binary is properly installed.      Deploying the TKG Management Cluster TKG can be deployed either through the UI or CLI. This walk-through will cover the UI deployment of TKG.\nBefore we can deploy TKG we must first download and import the Base OS Image and the API Server Load Balancer OVA\u0026rsquo;s into vSphere.\n    Once our templates are imported we can proceed to launch the TKG UI. Run the following command:\n1tkg init --ui  If Docker is not installed or running you will receive the following error. Make sure it is running and run the command again.\n     When the above command is run it will launch the UI, if not you can navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8080\nClick on Deploy on vSphere\n    Enter the vCenter Server, Username and Password and Click Connect.\n    If deploying to vSphere 7.0 you will be notified that it has not been optimized for Kubernetes but this just means you aren\u0026rsquo;t using vSphere with Kubernetes so click Proceed\n    Select your Datacenter and enter in your SSH Public Key\n     If you do not know your public key you can get it by running cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub If you need to generate an SSH keypair, the instructions are here\n     Select whether you wish to deploy for Development or Production and select a Size. Development is one Control Plane and one Worker and Production is three Control Planes and three Workers.\n    Name your Management Cluster and Select the Load Balancer Template\n    Specify the Resource Pool, VM Folder and Datastore for your VMs.\n    Select a Network for your VMs. You can leave the Service and Pod CIDR\u0026rsquo;s as default if you wish.\n    Select the Image Template you wish to use for your Kubernetes Cluster\n    Click on Review Configuration to Proceed.\n    Make sure everything entered looks correct and click on Deploy Management Cluster\n    Your cluster will now be deployed, when it is complete you will be presented with this screen!\n    Back to our CLI we can see the details of our management cluster by running:\n1tkg get management-cluster      Deploying the Tanzu Kubernetes Cluster Once our management cluster is deployed its quite easy to deploy our Tanzu Kubernetes Clusters!\nThere are a few advanced options but i will focus on two of the simple commands\nTo deploy a development cluster (1 control plane and 1 worker)\n1tkg create cluster tkc01 --plan=dev To deploy a production cluster (3 control plane and 3 worker)\n1tkg create cluster tkc --plan=prod To monitor the deployment status, you can run the following:\n1tkg get cluster      When it is complete we can see all the nodes that have been deployed!\n    Deploying a Workload to the Tanzu Kubernetes Cluster Find the Kubernetes Context you wish to deploy to:\n1kubectl config get-contexts      Switch to the context of your TKC.\n1kubectl config use-context tkc01-admin@tkc01 If we want to access our application through an external-ip.

This blog series will cover the requirements, prequisites and deployment steps in order to deploy a vSphere with Kubernetes (vk8s) environment using vSphere 7 and NSX-T 3.0.\nUsing vSphere with Kubernetes Now that we have the environment deployed, what can we do with it? This blog will cover Setting up the Kubernetes CLI, Configuring the TKC Content Library, Creating a Namespace and Deploying Native Pods.\nSetting up the Kubernetes CLI Tools Kubernetes is CLI driven, in order to use vSphere with Kubernetes you must install kubectl and also the vsphere plugin. This can be downloaded from your Supervisor Control Plane VM. The IP address of your Supervisor VM can be found on the Namespaces Overview or the Clusters tab of Workload Management. Navigate to https://{ipofyourvm}\n    From here you can download the CLI plugin for windows, macos or linux. Once it is downloaded extract the file and copy to your OS\u0026rsquo;s executable search path.\nType kubectl vsphere login -h and make sure the kubectl plugin works.\n    Configuring a Content Library for Tanzu Kubernetes Clusters When using TKC\u0026rsquo;s you can use different versions of Kubernetes. VMware does a great job of hosting these in a Content Library you can easily integrate with your environment!\nTo configure the Content Library navigate to Menu -\u0026gt; Content Libaries in the vSphere Client and Click on Create. Specify a name and choose with vCenter Server it will be created on.\n    Create a Subscribed Content Library using https://wp-content.vmware.com/v2/latest/lib.json as the subscription URL.\n    Select a Datastore for the content library images to be stored.\n    Review your settings and click Finish. Wait for the Content Library Items to be syncronized.\n    Creating and Configuring a Namespace A namespace is a unit of management in Kubernetes, in vSphere it is mapped to a resource pool and allows you to provision workloads and assign cpu, memory and storage.\nTo create a Namespace navigate to Menu -\u0026gt; Workload Management -\u0026gt; Namespaces and Click **Create Namespace\n    Select your Cluster and Specify a Name\n    Now we can see the Namespace Overview\n    Click Add Permission to assign permissions to the namespace. This can be any VC authenticated user.\n    Click Add Storage and select your VM Storage Policy. This is where pods will be deployed.\n    Click Add Library to associate the TKC Content Library to your Namespace.\n    Your Namespace is now ready to have workloads deployed!\n    Deploying a Workload Now that everything is ready, we can now deploy our first workload. I have created a GitHub Repo with some sample applications that can be deployed as Native Pods as well as some that require a TKC.\nMy first demo I use on every environment I deploy is hello-kubernetes I will walk you through a quick deployment of it.\nTo begin, authenticate to your vk8s cluster.\n1kubectl vsphere login --server 10.21.234.65 --vsphere-username administrator@vsphere.local --insecure-skip-tls-verify      Once logged in you will be shown the contexts aka namespaces you have access to. Lets switch to our namespace.\n1kubectl config use-context vk8s-ns-01      Execute your YAML file with your application\n1kubectl apply -f demo-hellokubernetes.yaml      View the svc information to find out the endpoint of the application deployed.\n1kubectl get svc      Access your application and validate it is running!\n    Wrap Up Wow that was easy! Kubernetes makes deploying workloads very seamless and deploying them on top of vSphere with Kubernetes is even better!

All the preparation you have done is now for this moment, infrastructure is deployed and networking is configured! The next section will cover enabling your environment\u0026rsquo;s first supervisor cluster.\nLets Begin!\nNavigate to Menu -\u0026gt; Workload Management. If we licensed our components and connected NSX correctly we should be ready to click Enable\n    Validate your cluster is Compatible. If it shows up under incompatible, it can be for a variety of reasons. For more details you can view /var/log/vmware/wcp/nsxd.log and /var/log/vmware/wcp/wcpsvc.log and they will provide the details on why.\n    Specify your Control Plane Size\n    Specify your Network Settings, double and triple check your entries as if you need to change anything you currently must disable Workload Management and redeploy.\n    Specify your Storage, this will be the vm storage policy we created earlier.\n    Review your settings and click Finish.\n    Workload Management will now be configured. This can take awhile depending on your environment. Expect at least 30 minutes. During this time the Kubernetes Status may show all sorts of errors. These can be ignored, focus on the state of Configuration Status\n    When the Configuration Status is Running and Everything is green. We can now proceed to use our vk8s environment.\n    Wrap Up Enabling Workload Management is quite easy! VMware has made it extremely simple to enable a Supervisor Cluster. Stay tuned for the next post where we learn how to use and deploy workloads to our newly provisioned environment.\n","permalink":"https://davidstamen.com/2020/04/10/part-4-deploying-vsphere-with-kubernetes-enabling-vsphere-with-kubernetes/","tags":["vk8s","NSX","Project Pacific","vSphere with Kubernetes"],"title":"Part 4: Deploying vSphere with Kubernetes - Enabling vSphere with Kubernetes"},{"categories":["Kubernetes","VMware"],"contents":"vSphere 7 with Kubernetes is finally here and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t be more excited for it to be available.

VMware has posted a blog that covers this, but the TLDR is you need VCF 4.0. You can learn more at Licensing for vSphere with Kubernetes \nAn alternative method in which I will use as VCF 4.0 has not been released is you can utilize the evaluation licenses built into vSphere and use those for the Workload Management aspects.

These are not only from a software and hardware level, but networking is the most important thing to pay attention to.\nVMware covers the minimum requirements and it goes into great detail. Hint: You need lots of CPU and memory!\nCompute In my deployment, I am using nested but the same allocations would apply to a physical deployment. I have my vk8s VC and ESXi hosts deployed to a management VC and my edges will be deployed to my vk8s VC.\n    I have 8 vCPU\u0026rsquo;s and 96GB assigned to my hosts. As i am not using VSAN I can get away with 2 hosts, however if using VSAN you must use a minimum of 4 hosts.\nStorage Throughout the beta and with my testing 1-2 TB is a good baseline depending on what you deploy, in this example ive provisioned a 500GB volume for my vk8s environment.\nNetworking Throughout the beta and even internally back at VMware the biggest reason an environment didnt function properly was not understanding the networking prerequisites. You WILL need a minimum of 3 separate routable VLANs. This will be for the management, ESXi TEP and Edge TEP interfaces. You will also need PLENTY of IPs.\n From your management network you will need an IP for VC, ESXi Hosts, NSX Manager, NSX Edge and 5 consequitive IPs for the Kubernetes Control Plane VMs. You will need a range or CIDR for each of your TEP VLANS. In my example i use a range from .10 - .50 for each. You will need from your overlay network (at least a /24) an IP for an uplink on each edge, and a minimum of 2 /27 block carved up from it. This will be used for the ingress and egress CIDR\u0026rsquo;s. These MUST be in the same network as your edge uplinks  vCenter Server As of now you cannot use vSphere with Kubernetes alongside some new features in vSphere 7 such as vSphere Lifecycle Manager. If you plan to use vk8s make sure you are still using baselines and not the new image management.\nWrap Up This post is an introduction of what you need in order to deploy vSphere with Kubernetes.

This does require a slight change on how you would normally register your arrays in the plugin, so lets take a look at how we can accomplish this!\nWhat’s New in 4.2.0 4.2.0 Release Notes\n Pure1 Authentication Busy Meter Display Intelligent VMFS Provisioning Pure1-driven FlashArray Fleet Registration Pure1 Array Tag Display vVol VM Undelete (Does not Require Pure1 Integration) Wizard-based Datastore Creation tool (Does not Require Pure1 Integration)  If we look closely 4 out of the 6 new features will require Pure1 Integration.\n    Creating the JSON Web Token (JWT) Luckily Cody Hosterman has made this super easy with the Pure Storage Pure1 PowerShell Module. Lets take a look at how we can create our JWT.\nIf it is not installed already we need to install the PowerShell Module.\n1Install-Module -Name PureStorage.Pure1 Once it is installed we can use the following cmdlet to create a Pure1 Certificate\n1$pure1cert = New-PureOneCertificate      Once the certificate is generated, we need to get the Public Key from the certificate.\n1Get-PureOnePublicKey -certificate $pure1cert      Now that we have the Public Key we can get the information needed to register for the API.\nNavigate to Pure1 and logon with an account with Administrator permissions to your Organization. From here click on API Registration.\n    Click on Register Application and Name your Application and enter the Public Key generated earlier. You will also need to update the Role from read-only to admin and click Upload.\n    From here you need to copy the Application ID that is listed as pure1:apikey:stringoflettersandnumbers. We will need this for the next step.\n    By default the expiration of a JWT with the Pure1 module is 30 days. Using PowerCLI you can update the expiration to be whatever you choose. In this example i will set it to expire in 2 years.\n1New-PureOneJwt -certificate $pure1cert -pureAppID pure1:apikey:pEbUxqz5ZxDwvTSX -expiration((Get-Date).AddYears(2)) Now that we have our JWT lets configure the vSphere Plugin.\n    Configure the vSphere Plugin Within the vSphere Client select the Pure Storage plugin. Click on Authenticate with Pure1 and paste your JWT.\n    Click on Authenticate and if you completed all the steps your array will now be Connected with Pure1.\n    We can now Import our arrays that are registered with Pure1. Click on Add and Import Arrays from Pure1. Enter the credentials and select the arrays you wish to add.\n         Now our arrays are added and any Pure1 tags will be shown.\n    Video Demonstration   Conclusion There are many things we can take advantage of now that the array is registered with Pure1.

Lets Dive in and take a look!\nConfiguring the vRealize Automation build-in vRealize Orchestrator Server Luckily when vRealize Automation is deployed, vRealize Orchestrator is included. How do you access it? Navigate to your default vRA URL and click on vRealize Orchestrator Client.\n    In order to setup the XaaS blueprints in vRealize Automation we must first import the Pure Storage Plugin, we can find out how to do that in my previous blog post located here.\nConfiguring vRealize Automation to deploy XaaS Blueprints Once your plugin has been imported to vRealize Orchestrator we can begin to setup vRealize Automation. To proceed lets navigate to the vRealize Automation Console.\nTo begin, if you have not already we must first create a Service.\n    You must also create a Business Group to create entitlements and allow users to request catalog items.\n    Deploying the vRealize Automation XaaS Blueprints We are now ready to begin deploying the Pure Storage XaaS Blueprints. Lets navigate to the Design tab to proceed.\n    Just as we did in our earlier blog post, before we can add a FlashArray Connection we must first Import the Certificate, so lets create that workflow first. Click on New, Navigate to Library, Pure Storage, Flash Array Connection Management and then Import FlashArray certification from URL\n    On this screen we can edit the Name and Description, but the defaults work so we can Click Next, Next, Next and then Finish.\n    Now we need to Publish the Blueprint so it is available to be pushed to the Catalog\n    If we navigate to our Catalog we won\u0026rsquo;t see it yet, this is because we need to associated it with the Service we created earlier. Navigate to Administration, Catalog Management, Catalog Items and select the Item and click Configure.\n    From here we can assign an Icon and associate it with the Service, luckily we have some Pure Storage icons available here.\n    But wait, we still can\u0026rsquo;t see the blueprint in our catalog! Well the last step is to create an Entitlement. Navigate to Administration, Catalog Management, Entitlements and Click New. Enter in the Name, Update the Status and select Users.\n    Assign the Service we created earlier and add in your Catalog Item.\n    if we browse to the Catalog tab our Blueprint is now there to Request.\n    To show the vRA workflows, repeat all these steps using the Add FlashArray Connection and Create VMFS Datastore on new FlashArray Volume XaaS blueprints.\n    Using the vRealize Automation XaaS Blueprints Catalog Items To begin lets run the Import FlashArray certificate from URL.

Dive in and take a look at how you can get your environment automated.\nDownloading the Pure Storage vRealize Orchestrator Plugin The Pure Storage Flash Array management pack is license free and can be downloaded from the VMware Marketplace. To download the plugin all you need to do is login or click on Login to Try and then once logged in you can click on the Try button to download the plugin.\n    Installing the Pure Storage vRealize Orchestrator Plugin At the time of writing the latest version of the Pure Storage Plugin for vRealize Orchestrator is 3.0.0 and is compatible up to vRealize Orchestrator 7.6. Support for vRealize Orchestrator 8.x will be available in a future release. You can find the Using the Pure Storage FlashArray Plugin for vRealize Orchestrator  on the Pure Storage Support site.\nAfter the Plugin is downloaded we need to login to the vRealize Orchestrator Control Center. From here we will click on Manage Plug-Ins.\n    Click Browse and Select the .VMOAPP and then Click Upload.\n    Accept the EULA, then Click Install.\n    Once the Plugin is installed. vRealize Orchestrator will restart 2 minutes after the last change. Restart your browser after that time frame to see the installed Plugin.\n    Using the Pure Storage vRealize Orchestrator Plugin Now that the Plugin is installed, we can logout of the Control Center and login to the Orchestrator Client. If we navigate to the Workflows section under Library we can filter for the Pure Storage workflows using the Pure_Storage tag.\n    Before we can use vRO to Register our FlashArray, if not using signed certificates we must first Import FlashArray certificate from URL. Thanks Jase for helping me when I was stuck on the first step!\n    We will click on Run to start the workflow entering in the IP or FQDN of our FlashArray and clicking the checkbox to accept a certificate with warnings. Once completed we can see the details in the Workflow Run\n    Next up we will run the Add FlashArray Connection workflow to add our FlashArray to vRealize Orchestrator. If the Autopopulate the REST versions is blank, you need to return to the previous step and Import the Certificate. I recommend using the 1.17 API version as later versions may have issues.\n    Once the FlashArray has been added what else can you do? Well the Pure Storage Plugin has 102 Workflows that can be used. The workflows included can be used to manage anything from the FlashArrays, Managing Volumes, Managing Hosts, Managing Replications, Managing Snapshots and more!\nFor a quick example of a workflow, lets provision a new datastore from the FlashArray to our ESXi Cluster. The workflow to do this is called Create VMFS Datastore on new FlashArray Volume.\n    We will click on Run and enter in the Configuration Parameters to Create your VMFS Datastore.         Once we click Run the workflow will go out and do all it needs to do such as create volume on the FlashArray, add it to the Host Group, Rescan the Hosts and then Provision the Datastore. Once it has completed successfully we can log into the vSphere Client and see the new provisioned Datastore.\n         Conclusion As you can see we have quite a few workflows to integrate Pure Storage FlashArray with VMware Orchestrator.

Information about the read/write latency and read/write bandwidth will be displayed.        Pure Environment  This dashboard will allow you to select an object and show the relationships. In this case we select a volume, and can see the FlashArray, Hosts, Datastore and Cluster associated with the volume.        Pure Hosted VMs  This dashboard will allow you to select the VM and see which datastore it is on, as well as the VM storage and Datastore storage metrics.        Volume Overview  The Volume Overview dashboard allows you to select a Volume and See the FlashArray relationship as well as Volume Metrics.        FlashArray Capacity  Last but not least the FlashArray Capacity dashboard will give you plenty of information on the Array and Volume Capacity usage.         Conclusion As you can see we pull in plenty of information in regards to the VMware and Pure Storage environments under one window.

If you followed my previous post on Installing and Updating the Pure Storage vSphere Plugin, you may be wondering well What\u0026rsquo;s Next? Now its time to use it, which will empower your VMware Administrators to be awesome Pure Storage Administrators without ever needing to login to the Pure Storage UI!\nConfiguring the vSphere Plugin Once the plugin has been installed it now has to be configured. When I say it must be configured, you need to add in your storage arrays. This can be accomplished 2 ways. Either by adding each array independently, or my connecting to Pure1 and importing your arrays.\n    For my first example I will be adding my standalone M50 array, by clicking the Add button and entering in a name, FQDN/IP and credentials.\n    Host and Cluster Based Tasks with the vSphere Plugin Once the plugin is configured, if we right-click a host or cluster we are presented with a few options.\n    Looking at the plugin dropdown, we can do the following:\n Configure iSCSI  This will enable the software iSCSI adapter if no hardware iSCSI Adapters exist, and add in the Pure Storage IiCSI IQN\u0026rsquo;s as dynamic discovery targets.   Add Host Group  This will create a host or host group on the Pure Storage Array so that Volumes can be provisioned. The host group will be named after the Cluster Name and Hosts will be named after the ESXi hostname.        Create Datastore  This will create a volume on the array, add it to the host group and then create a datastore on the ESXi Cluster. If we chose a VMFS datastore we can select VMFS5 or VMFS6. We also have the ability to create a Vvol datastore if the storage providers have been registered.        Create Snapshots  This will create a snapshot on a volume based on which datastore is selected in the wizard.        Update Cluster Protection  This will allow you to add the Cluster or Hosts to a Protection Group for scheduled snapshots or replication.         Datastore Based Tasks with the vSphere Plugin If we right click a VMFS datastore and browse to the Pure Storage section we can see some new options that were not available in the host and clusters view.\n    We can do the following:\n Resize Datastore  This will extend the volume on the Pure Storage Array and rescan VMFS volumes to detect the new storage capacity.        Rename Datastore  Not only will it rename the volume on the Pure Storage Array, it will rename the datastore to match. Nothing like having a volume and datastore not match names!        Run Space Reclamation  If not using VMFS6 with automatic space reclamation, it will kick off a reclamation job.        Schedule Space Reclamation  If you do not feel like running it manually, you can set a schedule to run on the datastore for every X number of weeks on a particular host.        Destroy Datastore  This will delete the datastore, Unmount it from hosts and delete the volume from the Pure Storage Array. The volume will be left in a destroyed state for 24 hours until it\u0026rsquo;s eradicated and gone for good.        Mount on Additional Hosts  This allows you to provision the volume to even more hosts and have it accessible with the click of a button!        Create Snapshot  As we mentioned earlier, this will create a volume snapshot of the datastore.        Update Datastore Protection  This will allow you to update the Pure Storage protection group for the datastore and volume.         There are also a few unique options when using right clicking a Vvol datastore.\n     Create Virtual Disk  This will clone an existing Virtual Disk attached to a Vvol VM.        Undelete Virtual Machine  As long as the VM on the Vvol datastore had a snapshot of the config volume you will be able to restore a deleted virtual machine.         Virtual Machine Based Tasks with the vSphere Plugin If we right click a virtual machine and browse to the Pure Storage section we can see even more options available. These options are only available if the VM is on a Vvol datastore, these options are not for VMFS based volumes.\n    We can do the following:\n Import Disk  This will allow you to attach an existing disk. This workflow will be used for clustered based volumes.        Restore Deleted Disk  If a Vvol disk was accidentally deleted and you are in the 24 hour window of the destroyed volume, it can be imported.         Video Demonstration   Conclusion This plugin has many features to keep you out of the Pure Storage UI and more are being added in every release.

As I get ramped up with the latest information I plan to do a series of getting started with Pure Storage features. These blogs will cover things such as the vSphere Client (HTML5) Plugin, FlashArray, FlashBlade and integrations with other VMware products. First up is learning to install and update the Pure Storage vSphere Client Plugin.\nIn this post we will cover how to install and update the vSphere Plugin using Powershell and PowerCLI. You could install the plugin using the Pure Storage UI, however why not use some automation?.\n    At the time of writing, the latest vSphere Plugin is version 4.2.0. However, because the array is running older code only 4.0.0 is available. If you want to get a newer version of the plugin you can contact Pure Storage Support and they can push the newer version to your array. This means that I am unable to use the latest version of the plugin even though it is compatible if I do not get it updated.\nInstalling the Pure Storage Powershell Module The Pure Storage Powershell Module for VMware is located in the Powershell Gallery and can be installed by running the following command\n1Install-Module -Name PureStorage.FlashArray.VMware It\u0026rsquo;s that easy!\nInstalling the Pure Storage vSphere Plugin Once you have the Pure Storage module isntalled, we can connect to the vCenter Server we wish to install the plugin to and run the Install-PfavSpherePlugin cmdlet to install it. If we wanted to, we could actually install a previous version.\nTo see versions available to install run:\n1Get-PfavSpherePlugin -html -previous      We see here that 4.2.0 is the latest but since we plan to perform an upgrade i will install version 4.1.0. See the below snippet on how to connect to vCenter Server and install the vSphere Plugin.\n 4.2.1 shows up under previous, even though it is a \u0026ldquo;newer\u0026rdquo; version it is not certified which is why it does not qualify to be the latest build.\n 1Connect-VIServer vcsa03.newstack.local -User administrator@vsphere.local -Password VMware1! 2Install-PfavSpherePlugin -version 4.1.0      Updating the Pure Storage vSphere Plugin To update the vSphere Plugin its the exact steps as the installation, you just specify no version (use the latest) or a newer version. Here i have left version empty so it will install the latest version which is 4.2.0.\n1Connect-VIServer vcsa03.newstack.local -User administrator@vsphere.local -Password VMware1! 2Install-PfavSpherePlugin      Verifying the Pure Storage vSphere Plugin Installed When we login to the vSphere Client you will see the Plugin has been installed but must be refreshed to be loaded. When the browser has been refreshed, we can see that the Pure Storage plugin has been installed and is pending configuration.\n    Uninstalling the Pure Storage vSphere Plugin Just in case you want to uninstall the Plugin, you can use the vCenter Server MOB or use the below Powershell cmdlet.\n1Connect-VIServer vcsa03.newstack.local -User administrator@vsphere.local -Password VMware1! 2Uninstall-PfavSpherePlugin Video Demonstration   Conclusion Installing and updating the Pure Storage plugin is quite simple!

Over the past two years I had the amazing opportunity to not only present to customers and partners in places I never imagined, but the ability to be an internal subject matter expert and create some amazing content. VMware is an amazing place to work and the relationships I\u0026rsquo;ve made and my impact to the products are beyond things I thought I could ever accomplish. However things must come to an end. The RIF had nothing to do about performance, it was strictly a business decision and many team members across multiple business units were affected. I wish everyone the best of luck, as there are some amazing things coming!\nWith that said, I am excited to announce that I will be joining Pure Storage as a Field Solutions Architect. In this role I will continue to focus on VMware integrations while being a key resource to the field.\nI am looking forward to joining the Pure family and excited to see what the future brings!\n    ","permalink":"https://davidstamen.com/2020/02/12/back-to-work-im-going-to/","tags":["Pure Storage","Career"],"title":"Back to Work, I'm Going to"},{"categories":["Certification"],"contents":"It has now been about two months since I have began learning Kubernetes as I started to cover Project Pacific in my new role. With that said, one of my goals was to achieve the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) to prove my current knowledge. This post will be a recap of my experience studying for the exam.\nI am one that likes to take Certifications to obtain a certificate stating I am a SME in a particular area. In this case Kubernetes was up on my list, safe to say on my first attempt i passed the exam!\n    What is the CKA? According to CNCF.io the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) program was created by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, in collaboration with The Linux Foundation, to help develop the Kubernetes ecosystem. As one of the highest velocity open source projects, Kubernetes use is exploding. The exam is 3 hours long and to pass you must achieve a score of 74%.\nThis is the first level certificate for Kubernetes, the next level is the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD), but ill save that one for later.\nWhat was the exam like? Taking the CKA exam was different than what I\u0026rsquo;m use to. Im use to traveling to a testing center which happens to be no where near me and taking the exam in an environment that I have no control over. The CKA and CKAD exams are taken in the comfort of your own home. The requirements are you must have your own computer that can run chrome or chromium browser, have reliable internet and a webcam and microphone. Your working surface must be clean and have nothing around that can help. In my case I had to use my webcam to pan around the room showing there was nothing on the walls, on my desk or behind my monitor. I even had to remove the pen holder from my desk which I find a little strange, but it was ok. Luckily you are also able to keep a drink on your desk, but it must be a clear liquid in a clear glass or unlabelled bottle. All of these things are documented in the CKA FAQ\nHow did I prepare? Well, up until about 2 months ago I had little to no experience with Kubernetes. Based on feedback from others i started with Nigel Poultons Getting Started with Kubernetes course. This course was able to prepare me with everything I needed to know about Kubernetes and set very great groundwork. Once I was ready to start to study for the CKA I was referred to another great course from Mumshad Mannambeth who I ironically met at KubeCon:San Diego and explained Project Pacific! He has a series on KodeKloud and Udemy. Both exams include a video series as well as a lab that can be used to study based on practice questions.\nExam Tips The CKA is an exam that is kind of an open book test. You are allowed to have a single tab open to anything in the *.kubernetes.io or github.com/kubernetes. This means not having to worry about YAML file structure or those commands that you can easily lookup. Kubernetes.io has a great search function but sometimes its easy to create bookmarks especially when the CKA Handbook provides you with the topics that will be on the exam.\nThe one item I think that can save the most time is enabling auto completion of kubectl commands, you can learn a really long complicated command and try to memorize it, or bookmark the kubectl cheatsheet which has that command and more!\nTo pass the exam, you must score a minimum of a 74%. The exam is 24 questions and each one has the weight of the question listed. Using the in-test notepad I recommend writing down the number to each question the weight and whether you think you got it correct or not, this helps you know when you might\u0026rsquo;ve achieved a passing score.\nConclusion All in all I was very satisfied in the exam quality and questions. I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel that the questions were too easy or too hard. The exam lasts for 3 hours and for the first time I actually utilized the full 3 hours and didn\u0026rsquo;t finish everything 100%. If you follow some of the tips in preparation you should be well prepared when you are ready!\nHave any other tips? Leave them in the comments for others.\n","permalink":"https://davidstamen.com/2020/01/13/my-certified-kubernetes-administrator-cka-exam-experience/","tags":["Kubernetes","CKA","Project Pacific"],"title":"My Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) Exam Experience"},{"categories":["VMware"],"contents":"Now that we have covered the considerations to backup each component in your vSphere Environment, it\u0026rsquo;s time to think about the rollback or restore process. In the previous post we discussed how to backup each individual component, in this post we will continue the conversation and discuss considerations to restore or rollback your vSphere Environment components.\nPlatform Services Controller / vCenter Server When things don\u0026rsquo;t go right with an update, upgrade or configuration change of your Platform Services Controller or vCenter Server you need to understand the proper steps it takes to rollback. In these scenarios sometimes there may have been a failure in the process, or after a successful upgrade was completed, an incompatibility was found which would result in a rollback. A reason we see the need to rollback a vCenter Server is when a supporting solution such as a backup vendor or monitoring vendor is not compatible. In this case you will need to revert to the previous version.\nScenario 1: Embedded vCenter Server Appliance (No Enhanced Linked Mode) When you need to rollback a Standalone vCenter Server with an Embedded Platform Services due to a failed upgrade or migration—shutdown the new vCenter Server Appliance, power on the original and rejoin to the domain if it previously was.\nIn the event the rollback occurs due to a patch or configuration change, the rollback process will include restoring from the file-based or image-based backup taken.\nScenario 2: Embedded vCenter Server Appliance in Enhanced Linked Mode In case you happen to have multiple Embedded vCenter Servers in Enhanced Linked Mode, the rollback and recovery of this is a bit different than Scenario 1.\nAs the Embedded vCenter Server contains PSC related data we cannot just revert a snapshot of a vCenter Server running in linked mode. There are pre-built checks in the vCenter Server that will look for inconsistencies and if any major issues occur the PSC service could go into read-only mode.\nIn order to properly restore an Embedded vCenter Server that is in Enhanced Linked Mode we must perform a restore that was taken with an Image or File-Based Backup. The File-Based Restore wizard contains logic to detect if the node was in linked mode and instead of restoring the stale data, it will perform a reconciliation and synchronize the PSC data from another vCenter Server in the SSO domain instead of restoring it. If you restore an Embedded vCenter Server from an image-based backup you must log into the VAMI and manually run reconciliation.\n    Scenario 3: External Platform Services Controller As we discussed in Scenario 2 if a vCenter Server had PSC data we did not want to restore old data. The same applies to a standalone External PSC, if we need to rollback a single PSC we will shut down the node and unregister it from the SSO domain. We will then redeploy the PSC using the same FQDN and IP and allow it to synchronize the data. The only time a PSC should be restored from backup is if all PSC\u0026rsquo;s within an SSO domain are unavailable.\n    Scenario 4: External vCenter Server Last but not least as we wrap up we will talk about restoring an External vCenter Server. When you need to rollback an External vCenter Server due to a failed upgrade or migration—shutdown the new vCenter Server Appliance, power on the original and rejoin to the domain if it previously was. In the event you need to roll back from a patch or configuration change an External vCenter Server contains no PSC data, it is fine to perform a restore from an image based or file-based backup.\nESXI Server Certain scenarios may require you to rollback an ESXi Server. Whether there was an issue with an update, upgrade or software installation we will cover two scenarios to rollback an ESXi Server.\nScenario 1: Reverting using the Built-in Recovery The most common method used to rollback an ESXi Host is the built-in recovery. [Using the Direct Console User Interface (DCUI)][https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/1033604] you have the ability to revert to a previous installation using the altbootbank. This is the simpler of the two scenarios, but a previous version is not always available. In the event a previous version is unavailable you will need to proceed with restoring using a configuration backup.\n        Scenario 2: Reverting using Configuration Backup The next method to recover an ESXi Host is to restore a previous configuration. If an altbootbank is not available to use the built-in recovery you must first install ESXi Server from media. Using the configuration backup, you can perform a restore to bring the host back to its configured state. In some environments host profiles are not used, which is why having a configuration backup can make a restore simpler.\nVMware Tools / VM Compatibility Downgrading of VMware Tools is not supported. In the event of a need to revert to a previous version of VMware Tools, you must first uninstall the newer version of VMware Tools and then install the older version of VMware Tools.\nUnlike VMware Tools there is no process to perform an in-place downgrade of VM Compatibility / Virtual Hardware. To downgrade your virtual machine hardware version you have 3 options:\n Revert to a previous backup or snapshot of the Virtual Machine prior to upgrading virtual hardware. Create a new virtual machine mirroring the original specifications using a previous hardware version and attach the existing disk from the virtual machine. Use VMware Converter to perform a VM to VM conversion choosing a previous hardware version for the destination.  Storage (VMFS/VSAN) When performing a rollback of a VMFS-6 volume it follows the same steps as an upgrade to VMFS-6. When Migrating VMFS-5 to VMFS-6 there was no in-place upgrade. The same applies to a downgrade. In order to downgrade a VMFS-6 volume to VMFS-5 you must first create a new VMFS-5 Volume and then perform a storage migration of Virtual Machines.\nGenerally, it is not recommended to downgrade a vSAN Disk Format. However, in some scenarios you may wish to format a [vSAN][7] Disk Group with a legacy format version. This process includes the ability to evacuate a disk group and choose a legacy disk version by modifying an advanced setting and then recreating a disk group. This is only applicable to vSAN 6.x versions.\nNetwork (VDS) Last but not least let\u0026rsquo;s review the scenario of having to rollback a previous vSphere Distributed Switch version. If you have ever performed an upgrade you may notice on the screen, that a distributed switch cannot be downgraded, however there is a process in order to perform a restore which will allow us to go back to a previous distributed switch version.\n    In order to \u0026ldquo;restore\u0026rdquo; a distributed switch configuration you must first create a Distributed Switch at the correct target version and choose the option to import configuration preserving the original distributed switch and port group identifiers. If you would attempt to restore a distributed switch configuration on top of the existing, it would leave the current distributed switch version intact.\nResources  Restore a vCenter Server Appliance from a File-Based Backup Restore a vCenter Server Instance with an Embedded Platform Services Controller Unregister PSC or vCenter Server from SSO Domain using CMSSO-UTIL Reverting to a previous version of ESXi Restoring ESXi host configuration data Downgrade of VMware Tools is not supported Downgrading the virtual machine hardware version in ESX/ESXi Migrating VMFS 5 datastore to VMFS 6 datastore How to format vSAN Disk Groups with a legacy format version Restore a vSphere Distributed Switch Configuration Export, Import, and Restore vSphere Distributed Port Group Configurations  Conclusion Although we don\u0026rsquo;t like to anticipate any issues in our vSphere Environment, it is important to not only take regular backups of our environment, but to also practice restoring outside of any lifecycle activities. When thinking about backing up and restoring vSphere Components it is important to consider the different parts of your environment and the impact restoring that component will have in your environment.\nIf you have any questions, comments or feedback, feel free to leave them below or reach out on twitter at @davidstamen.\nOriginally Posted on blogs.vmware.com/vsphere\n","permalink":"https://davidstamen.com/2019/10/23/considerations-for-vsphere-component-backup-and-restore-part-2/","tags":["vSphere","Backup","Restore","vCenter Server","ESXi"],"title":"Considerations for vSphere Component Backup and Restore: Part 2"},{"categories":["VMware"],"contents":"You spend time planning and implementing updates, upgrades and configuration changes to vSphere Environments. Rollback or recovery is usually the last thing on the mind. Did you know there are multiple ways to successfully backup each component in a vSphere Environment? There are also many ways to recover those same components.\nIn this series we will talk about considerations to backup and restore or rollback your vSphere environment if we have a need to.\nWhen we discuss our vSphere Components, I am talking about the core product.\n Platform Services Controller / vCenter Server ESXi Hosts VM Compatibility / VM Tools Storage (VMFS/VSAN) Network (VDS)  The backup and recovery for each component is different. vCenter Server has a native file-based backup, whereas everything else does not have a native backup tool. Below I will provide guidance and considerations when backing up your vSphere Environment.\nIntroduction Prior to starting any changes in your vSphere Environment backups should be taken. Backing up your environment does not necessarily have an order of backups, but if you think about dependencies, I like to backup my environments in the same order as an upgrade is completed.\n    Each component has different considerations. Is my vCenter Server running 6.0, 6.5 or 6.7? Is it appliance based, or windows based? Am I using features such as vCenter HA or Content Library\u0026rsquo;s? Those are all very important questions! vCenter Server 6.5 and 6.7 have a native file-based backup, this will include the configuration, inventory and historical data such as tasks, events and performance data. If using vCenter Server for Windows, backup can be accomplished using an image-based backup tool as well as a backup of the database. Features such as vCenter HA are not needed to be backed up, as the server is restored as a standalone node. Features such as Content Library will have all the configuration and metadata restored, but the files contained in a Content Library are stored within the datastore itself, so those are some considerations to think about.\nThere are also many ways to backup each component, and not just differences like image-based vs file-based. Components can be backed up through the vSphere Client, API, vSphere CLI, ESXCLI, DCLI and PowerCLI.\nPlatform Services Controller / vCenter Server When considering backups for the Platform Services Controller or vCenter Server there are a few methods that can be used. If using a Windows based Platform Services Controller or vCenter Server the supported backup process is to take an image based backup of the Machine and a database backup. If utilizing the vCenter Server Appliance on vSphere 6.5 or vSphere 6.7 the recommended backup method is to use the File-Based backup. The file-based backup is not only available in the vCenter Appliance Management Interface (VAMI) but also has an API and DCLI commands.\nPerforming an online snapshot of your environment is not recommended or supported. If the need arises to snapshot the environment, all nodes in the SSO domain should be powered off. This can be problematic as all nodes within the SSO domain must be shutdown causing a downtime. In the event of a recovery you would not be allowed to recover one node from snapshot, the entire environment would need to be reverted.\nESXi Hosts ESXi Hosts do not have a native full backup tool like vCenter Server. There are some considerations to think about; Are my hosts stateless or stateful? Am I using Host Profiles?\nIf your environment is stateless, a backup and recovery is simple. Update the image profile and perform a reboot of the host, during the boot process a new image will be used and the host profile configuration will be applied.\nIf your environment is stateful there are a couple options for backup. Using vSphere CLI or PowerCLI you can export the configuration of your ESXi Host, whereas if using host profiles, the configuration will be stored along with an answer file on the vCenter Server.\n PowerCLI 1Get-VMHostFirmware -VMHost ESXi_host_IP_address -BackupConfiguration -DestinationPath output_directory  vSphere CLI: 1vicfg-cfgbackup --server=ESXi_host_IP_address --username=root -s output_file_name   Virtual Machines: VMware Tools / VM Compatibility In order recover a VM in the event you encounter issues with a VM Tools or VM Compatibility update—it\u0026rsquo;s important to make sure you have a snapshot or full backup of your virtual machine. Recovery may not always require this backup, but it\u0026rsquo;s good to have a point in time to recover.\nStorage: VMFS / VSAN Storage arrays whether they are VSAN, ISCSI, NFS or FC cannot be backed up directly. In this case, we need to protect the workloads on them instead of the storage itself. For rollback the same holds true, in the event we have a need to rollback a version of VMFS or VSAN the exact steps in the next post in the series.\nNetwork: vSphere Distributed Switch Last but not least, it is important to take a backup of your vSphere Distributed Switch. A vCenter Server backup does include a copy of the VDS, however if you have a need to recover it separately, a backup and export of the switch should be taken.\n        Resources  Image-Based Backup and Restore of a vCenter Server Environment File-Based Backup and Restore of vCenter Server Appliance KB2149237: Overview of Backup and Restore options in vCenter Server 6.x Video: Talking Code – VCSA File-Based Backup with PowerCLI Blog: Automating File-Based Backups of vCenter Server Appliance Walkthrough: vCenter Server Appliance 6.7 File-Based Backup Walkthrough: vCenter Server Appliance 6.5 File-Based Backup DCLI: File-Based Backup API: File-Based Backup KB2042141: How to back up ESXi host configuration Backing Up and Restoring a vSphere Distributed Switch Configuration PowerCLI: Export-VDSwitch  Conclusion As we think about backing up our vSphere Environment it\u0026rsquo;s good to know that we have options when it comes to backing up each component. It\u0026rsquo;s also good to understand the dependencies and order when backing up each piece. In the next part in the series we will discuss the rollback or recovery of each component and the considerations for each.\nIf you have any questions, comments or feedback, feel free to leave them below or reach out on twitter at @davidstamen.\nOriginally Posted on blogs.vmware.com/vsphere\n","permalink":"https://davidstamen.com/2019/10/21/considerations-for-vsphere-component-backup-and-restore-part-1/","tags":["vSphere","Backup","Restore","vCenter Server","ESXi"],"title":"Considerations for vSphere Component Backup and Restore: Part 1"},{"categories":["VMware"],"contents":"VMworld US has wrapped up and now its time to focus on VMworld EU!

This impacts quite a few folks who may have deployed their vCenter Server for Windows on these Operating Systems. I have been asked quite often recently, \u0026ldquo;What are my options?\u0026rdquo; Let\u0026rsquo;s dive in and find out what it takes to move to a supported OS!\nMigrate to the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) Mentioned in August 2017,Farewell, vCenter Server for Windows. The VCSA is now the default deployment recommended for vCenter Server. If you are currently running vCenter Server on Windows, during your next upgrade you should be migrating to the VCSA. Features such as many performance and security enhancements and new features such as vCenter HA and the File-Based Backup are exclusive to the VCSA.\nVMware has provided a migration tool directly in the VCSA Installer for 6.5 and 6.7. This migration tool will deploy a brand new VCSA running the latest version, and then import the data from the source Windows vCenter Server shutting it down in the process. This migration option allows you to maintain the same PNID, UID, Certificates, Tags, Roles, etc\u0026hellip;.including the VDS!\n    If you want to learn more on Migration to the VCSA, check out vSphere Central\nMigrate to vCenter Server on Windows Server 2012/2016/2019 If you are unfortunately unable to migrate to the VCSA, there is an alternative option. It is NOT SUPPORTED to do an in-place upgrade from 2008 to a newer operating system with vCenter Server installed. KB2018695 can be referenced for more information but explicitly states:\n VMware does not support the installation of major update releases on an operating system as an upgrade in a virtual machine, such as Windows 7 to Windows 8 or RHEL 5.x to RHEL 6.0. VMware recommends the installation of a new major releases in a new virtual machine.\n The only supported method would be to take a backup of the existing environment including the database. You will then shutdown the old Windows Server 2008 vCenter Server, and deploy a new VM running your newer operating system with the exact same FQDN and IP. Once this machine is online, you would re-install vCenter Server for Windows using your existing vCenter Server Database.\nThe backup and restore options for vCenter Server 6.x are outlined in the following KB2149237. However please note there could be some considerations such as change of UUID, loss of certificates, tags, roles and other policies, so when migrating or moving the vCenter Server database check out KB2144536 for more information!\nWrap Up Its a good idea to keep an eye on EOL/EOGS dates for products you have running in your environment. To understand the EOGS support for VMware Products you can find more information on the VMware Lifecycle Matrix.\n","permalink":"https://davidstamen.com/2019/08/12/windows-server-2008-is-going-eol-what-about-my-vcenter-server/","tags":["vCenter Server","vSphere 6.7","vCenter Server 6.5"],"title":"Windows Server 2008 is Going EOL - What about my vCenter Server?"},{"categories":["VMware"],"contents":"vSphere 6.5 first introduced vCenter HA and since its inception has been deployed in many environments. When it comes to upgrading or updating your vCenter HA environment there are some specific considerations. If you have wondered what it takes to handle the lifecycle of a vCenter HA enabled vCenter Server, keep reading!\nvCenter HA Overview vCenter HA has seen wide adoption as customers wish to provide provide high availability for their vCenter Server. VMware Solutions such as Site Recovery Manager, NSX and Horizon View rely heavily on the availability of the vCenter Server being online, so having a low RPO and RTO assists in availability of these business critical applications. vCenter Server 6.7 Update 1 introduced workflow improvements by bringing vCenter HA into the vSphere Client. There are no longer two separate Basic and Advanced workflows. If the vCenter Server is self-managed the passive and witness nodes will be automatically deployed. However, if the vCenter Server is not self-managed the workflow will prompt you for the managing vCenter Servers credential.\nvCenter HA functions by cloning the vCenter Server to an active and passive node. This process creates a vCenter Server High Availability group which allows the management IP to failover between the active and passive nodes. For more information please see vCenter High Availability Deep Dive – Part 1 or vCenter High Availability Deep Dive – Part 2\n    Snapshots are not supported when vCenter HA is enabled. Prior to any updates or upgrades a vCenter Server File-Based Backup should be taken.\nUpdating a vCenter Server 6.5 Environment With vSphere 6.5 there are two options when it comes to updating your vCenter Server.\nThe first option consists of leaving the configuration intact during updating. As only the active vCenter Server Appliance has access to the management network, this method requires downloading the vCenter Server patch ISO\u0026rsquo;s from the VMware Patch Portal and performing the updates through the command-line interface. This method provides the least amount of downtime for your environment and is documented in our VMware vSphere Product Documentation.\nThe process begins by placing vCenter HA into maintenance mode, which still allows data replication but will disable automatic failover. The patch ISO is mounted to the active, passive and witness vCenter Server nodes. Using the active vCenter Server node as a jumpbox, SSH into the witness performing an update through the software-packages utility. Once the update is complete you will reboot the witness vCenter Server. When the witness is back online you will repeat the process on the passive vCenter Server. Once both the witness and passive nodes are up to date, perform a manual failover. This failover will promote the passive node to the active node having it running the new vCenter Server version. When the failover is complete, using new active vCenter Server as a jumpbox SSH into the passive node performing one last final update. The vCenter Server environment is now updated to the latest version.\nThe second option consists of removing the vCenter HA configuration to be left with a standalone vCenter Server. This method provides a more simplistic approach to updating your environment.\nIf your vCenter Server has internet access you can easily download and install updates from the online repository. However, if your vCenter Server does not have internet access you have the option to either download the ISO and mount it to the vCenter Server Appliance or use an offline repository option. Once updated, vCenter HA can be re-deployed to protect the vCenter Server instance.\nUpdating a vCenter Server 6.7 Environment With vSphere 6.7 there is only one option to update a vCenter Server. Due to changes in the DB schema, the only supported option is to remove vCenter HA configuration and update the vCenter Server as described in the second option above.\nMore information on these changes is documented in KB55938\nvCenter Server Upgrades Upgrading a vCenter Server Appliance from 6.5 to 6.7 configured with vCenter HA requires the configuration to be removed. Beginning with vSphere 6.7 Update 1 the vCenter Server Upgrade installer can detect when vCenter HA is enabled and automatically handle the upgrade process by removing the configuration prior to the upgrade, and then re-deploying vCenter HA once the upgrade is complete.\n    When vCenter Server Upgrade installer detects vCenter HA is enabled on the source appliance, existing witness and passive nodes will be shutdown and deleted. A new vCenter Server Appliance will be deployed as part of the upgrade process and vCenter HA will automatically be re-deployed when the upgrade completes. If preferred to not have the process done automatically, the vCenter HA configurationcan be removed and a standalone upgrade performed of the vCenter Server.\n    Wrap Up Handling the lifecycle of a vCenter Server with vCenter HA doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be difficult; when armed with the right knowledge it can be quite simple.\nFor more information on using vCenter HA or vCenter Server File-Based Backup and Restore, I recommend checking out Day 2 Operations Section on vSphere Central.\nOriginally Posted on blogs.vmware.com/vsphere\n","permalink":"https://davidstamen.com/2019/07/30/handling-the-lifecycle-of-a-vcenter-ha-environment/","tags":["vCenter HA","vCenter Server","Lifecycle"],"title":"Handling the Lifecycle of a vCenter HA Environment"},{"categories":["VMware"],"contents":"VMworld US 2019 is just around the corner and the session acceptance emails have just been sent out.

Join Paudie and Gourav as they discuss these concepts in depth from both an engineering perspective and a practical real-world perspective.\n","permalink":"https://davidstamen.com/2019/06/18/vmworld-2019-sessions-and-events/","tags":["VMworld"],"title":"VMworld 2019 - Sessions and Events"},{"categories":["VMware"],"contents":"As more customers get ready to run the vCenter Server Converge Tool in their environments, a common question that has been asked is \u0026ldquo;What Happens to my Certificates?\u0026rdquo; Well that is a good question so lets find out!\n    When using certificates in your vSphere Environment there have traditionally been a few ways to deploy them.\n Default VMCA Subordinate CA Hybrid Mode Custom Certificates  Bob Plankers has a very good post on our vSphere Blogs which cover 10 Things To Know about vSphere Certificate Management\nDefault VMCA Included in vCenter Server 6.0 is a VMware Certificate Authority also known as the VMCA. This is usually used as the default unless customers have requirements to use 3rd party signed certificates. This is also the most common as you can easily download the VMCA Root Certificates from your vCenter Server and add them to your trusted root authority either manually or via group policy. This easily meets the requirements for customers who wish to \u0026ldquo;get rid of the red X\u0026rdquo; in the address bar.\nIn the case of vCenter Server Convergence, vCenter Server automatically regenerates any certificates and there are no additional tasks needed.\nSubordinate CA This Subordinate CA method is one that when implemented, the VMCA actually becomes a subordinate CA of your Microsoft Certificate Authority. In this case it is not recommended as it does pose some risks as you cannot actually validate from your Root CA what certificates are being issued. This also poses problems with vCenter Server convergence as VMware does not have the ability to move the Subordinate CA.\nIn the case of vCenter Server Convergence, VMware recommends moving to the Hybrid Certificate or Default VMCA Model. If you must continue to use Subordinate CA, you will need to Converge your vCenter Server, then change the Embedded vCenter Server to be a Subordinate CA, reissue certificates and then decommission the external PSC and Old Subordinate CA.\nHybrid Mode Other then using the Default VMCA, the Hybrid Model is the next recommended approach. When doing a Hybrid Mode certificate setup you replace the machine certificates with 3rd Party certificates allowing all web services to be trusted, while your ESXi hosts still utilize the VMCA for certificates.\nIn the case of vCenter Server Convergence, as nothing is using the External PSC directly, during the vCenter Server convergence no changes are needed.\nCustom Certificates Custom certificates are one of the most difficult certificate solutions to use. This is where no Certificate Authorities are used and EVERY certificate is replaced manually. This is traditionally used only in extremely secure locations such as government.\nIn the case of vCenter Server Convergence, as nothing is using the External PSC directly, during the vCenter Server convergence no changes are needed.\nWrap Up Hopefully this has helped clarify some questions around using certificates with the vCenter Server converge tool, don\u0026rsquo;t forget to review the additional resources below.\nAdditional Resources  Documentation: Certificate Management Overview Blog: 10 Things To Know About vSphere Certificate Management Blog: Hybrid vSphere SSL Certificate Replacement) Blog: vCenter Server Converge Tool - How do I Converge an Environment Using the UI Blog: Understanding the vCenter Server Converge Tool Blog: vCenter Server Converge Tool Enhancements in vSphere 6.7 Update 2 Product Walkthrough: Converging a Load Balanced External vCenter Deployment using the vSphere Client Product Walkthrough: Converging an External vCenter Deployment using the vSphere Client Documentation: vCenter Server Converge Tool ","permalink":"https://davidstamen.com/2019/06/07/vcenter-server-converge-tool-what-about-my-certificates/","tags":["vCenter Server","vSphere 6.7","Converge Tool","Certificates"],"title":"vCenter Server Converge Tool - What About My Certificates"},{"categories":["VMware"],"contents":"I am proud to announce that my first VMware Clarity Project the VCSA JSON Creator is now live! This has been something I have wanted to do for some time, and am glad to finally have the first version available for feedback. Let\u0026rsquo;s dive in and take a look.\nI first want to start off that I would not have been able to do this without the awesome Cody De Arklandexplaining how to get started with Clarity UI.\nWhen I discuss with customers about using the vCenter Server Appliance CLI Tools that have been included since vSphere 6.5, they tend to not have used it before. When I have asked why, I normally hear that the JSON is too complex to figure out.\nWith this being said I am proud to share my first ClarityUI Project the VCSA JSON Creator 9000\nWhy? I have built the VCSA JSON Creator to be used as a resource to understand how the JSON templates should be created. I currently have two wizards created and I hope to create more based on feedback.\nCurrent\n* Installation of an Embedded VCSA 6.7 * Upgrade of an Embedded VCSA 6.5 to 6.7 * Migration of an Embedded Windows vCenter Server 6.5 to 6.7 - Added 4/25/19 * Converge of External PSC - Added 5/2/19 * Decommission of External PSC - Added 5/2/19 * Add Download of JSON Template - Added 5/7/19 * Upgrade of External PSC Appliance and External vCenter Server Appliance - Added 5/8/19  Planned\n* Migration of External PSC and External vCenter Server  How does it work? If you take a look at the tool it should look very similar to the vSphere Client. This is because its using the awesome Clarity Design Interface. When you navigate to the homescreen you will see the wizards that are currently available. At this time we can choose create a JSON for an Installation of an Embedded 6.7 VCSA or an Upgrade of a VCSA from 6.5 to 6.7.\n    For this example we have chosen to do an Install of an Embedded VCSA 6.7. When the wizard is launched you will be prompted for all of the standard information requested as part of the manual creation of the JSON. If you have any questions on how fields should be populated or the format, you can access the link to the documentation or select the (i) signpost to view more information about the fields. Once the first section is filled out we can proceed.\n    Once we have filled out the first section with the Appliance Deployment Information we can input information for configuration. To simplify this screen a few fields have built-in dropdown\u0026rsquo;s for the requested items. Proceed to fill in all available fields and then proceed to click next.\n    Once all our fields have been filled out, your JSON will now be created. You can review how the fields have been entered and then Copy the file to your favorite text editor and save it as a Filename.json.\n A download button should hopefully be added in the next update.\n     Conclusion Using the CLI based tools doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be overwhelming, hopefully this tool can help you understand the process to create the JSON and maybe even save you some time. Look at the additional resources for some references on how to use the VCSA CLI Installer once you have your JSON created. Have any feedback?

Inside this update include enhancements to the vCenter Server Converge Tool. Let\u0026rsquo;s dive in and take a look at whats new and see how to converge a deployment using the new UI.\nIncluded in vSphere 6.7 Update 2 is an overhauled system configuration section. Within system configuration you have a table view showing you the Platform Services Controllers and vCenter Servers in your Environment.\nvCenter Server Topology View Alongside the new system configuration table view there is a new topology view. This view allows you to have a graphical representation of the nodes in your SSO domain. This is useful when someone might\u0026rsquo;ve configured additional replication agreements between External Platform Services Controllers. Previously the only method to view replication agreements was using vdcrepadmin against each PSC in your environment to manually build out the topology diagram.\n    When I am in the field we tend to inform users about how to properly setup additional replication agreements in an SSO domain when using 3 or more External PSCs or Embedded vCenter Servers. My recommendation is to create one additional replication agreement to be used as a ring topology. At some point I have heard of customers using a mesh topology, without mapping out all the replication agreements they may have never known they were in a non-recommended topology. Using the new topology view you can easily see if someone incorrectly setup additional replication agreements and then go back in and clean them up using vdcrepadmin.\n    vCenter Server Converge Tool UI When reviewing the new table view you might have noticed two new buttons. You now have the ability ability to Converge and Decommission nodes through the vSphere Client. No longer are you required to utilize the CLI and JSON templates to run the converge tool! This is great for customers or partners who wish for a simplistic and foolproof method to migrate their vSphere Environment to an Embedded vCenter Server Deployment.\n    I will run through a convergence example of a vSphere Environment that has two External PSCs and two External vCenter Servers. I will be migrating these nodes to vCenter Servers with an Embedded PSC.\n    Once I have selected our vCenter Server Appliance that we wish to converge to embedded I will first be notified that the vCenter Services will be restarted and then the next step will proceed to the information gathering screen. If you have previously used the CLI based Converge Tool you might of remember being prompted for the managing vCenter Server credentials. This is no longer needed as the vCenter Server Converge Tool is already aware of this information.\n    On this screen I\u0026rsquo;ll will be prompted certain pieces of information:\n External PSC SSO Username and Password  Needed to be able to install the required components to the vCenter Server and allow replication between the new embedded vCenter Server and the existing External PSC.   New Replication Partner  As seen below you can see that no embedded node is available. This is because this is the first node I have ran the converge utility against and it will reuse the existing replication agreement. When I proceed to converge any additional vCenter Servers I will see the already existing vCenter Servers with an Embedded PSC and will have the ability to choose a replication partner.   Skip AD Join or Join AD  If you wish to join your vCenter Server Appliance to Active Directory then select this option and you will prompted to enter in additional information.         Acknowledge that you have made a backup of your vCenter Server Appliance before initiating convergence.  This is extremely important as you are making major changes to your vSphere Environment. Before proceeding with convergence not only should you back up the node you are currently converging, but you should be backing up ALL External PSC and vCenter Servers within your SSO domain. To perform a backup you should be using the built in file-based backup in the VAMI and NOT relying on snapshots.    Once I have successfully converged both our vCenter Servers I can now proceed to decommission the two External PSC\u0026rsquo;s. As we are already aware of the managing vCenter Server all we need to do is enter in the vCenter Server SSO credentials so that the external PSC can be shutdown and unregistered from the SSO domain.\n    Now that the converge and decommission process is completed, I will go back and review the toplogy view to see that we now have migrated to our simplified deployment topology using Embedded PSCs.\n    Additional Resources  Blog: Understanding the vCenter Server Converge Tool Blog: vCenter Server Converge Tool Enhancements in vSphere 6.7 Update 2 Product Walkthrough: Converging a Load Balanced External vCenter Deployment using the vSphere Client Product Walkthrough: Converging an External vCenter Deployment using the vSphere Client Documentation: vCenter Server Converge Tool ","permalink":"https://davidstamen.com/2019/04/11/vcenter-server-converge-tool-how-do-i-converge-an-environment-using-the-ui/","tags":["vCenter Server","vSphere 6.7","Converge Tool"],"title":"vCenter Server Converge Tool - How do I Converge an Environment Using the UI"},{"categories":null,"contents":"David Stamen is a Field Solutions Architect focused on VMware and Cloud solutions at Pure Storage.\nI can be found blogging at:\n http://davidstamen.com https://blogs.vmware.com/code/author/dstamen1 https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/author/dstamen  I am also glad to be part of the following programs:\n VMware vExpert VMware Code Coach  And I can also be found on Twitter and on LinkedIn\n","permalink":"https://davidstamen.com/about/","tags":null,"title":"About Me"},{"categories":["VMware"],"contents":"Previously I covered how to use the VCSA Installer to do a scripted upgrade and then I covered Patching the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) using the REST API - Part 1 (Postman Collection) However, after learning recently how to call API\u0026rsquo;s from Powershell I thought to myself, why not write a Powershell Module for this?\nIntroduction Using tools such as Postman can make it utilizing API\u0026rsquo;s a bit easier, but you still need to be familiar with a separate tool or UI.

The next step I wanted to cover was patching the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) using the REST API.\nI previously wrote about Automating your vCenter Server Upgrade and created a feature-walkthrough which covers vCenter Server Upgrade using the VCSA CLI.\nWith vSphere 6.7 VMware introduced new REST API\u0026rsquo;s. You can learn more about those using the VMware Code online documentation. VMware initially introduced the update REST updates in vSphere 6.5 but they were under tech-preview and limited. With full support in vSphere 6.7 I wanted to cover the REST API\u0026rsquo;s that are available to handle lifecycle of your VCSA.\nIntroduction For those of you who may not be familiar with REST API\u0026rsquo;s it might be intimidating to use them, however using tools such as Postman can make it a bit easier. Postman is a GUI based tool that allows you to create API samples to use and share. When I first was learning about APIs I was completely lost, however when I saw the VMware Code Team had Postman samples already created it helped me learn how to handle some APIs. However when browsing the samples, I had noticed there were no ones currently available for vSphere 6.7 Update REST API. Using the samples and the REST API documentation I was able to update and give back to the community and we will review the REST API based methods to patch your VCSA.\nPostman Collection I have done a pull request to get these added to the VMware Code Repository. However until that is complete, you can find a copy of the Postman samples on my Github here.\nExploring the API When it comes to exploring the available API\u0026rsquo;s we have a few options. The first is to read the documentation. When reviewing the documentation it will give you details such as the HTTP request, parameters and response but if you are not familiar with the API\u0026rsquo;s then this can be quite difficult.\n    This is where API Explorer comes in. API Explorer is available at https://fqdnOFvcsa/apiexplorer and it allows you to explore the API, not only do we give you details such as the HTTP, Parameters and Response but we actually allow you to try it out against the live environment and it will provide you the associated curl command and syntax along with the full response body of your request.\n    Using the API Explorer and documentation we can see the updates are broken down in into 5 main sections.\n* Cancel - Cancellation of an update currently in progress. * Get - Gets the status of the appliance update. * Pending - Allows the manipulation of pending updates. This includes listing, staging, install,precheck and validation. * Policy - Get's or set's the background check for the new updates. * Staged - Get's or delete's a staged update.  Usage of the REST API Using Postman  I will not go into the setup of Postman variables, but before proceeding up validate you have your Environmental Variables setup for vc, sso-password, user and password.\n Login and Logout of the VCSA REST API Just like using a GUI or a Script the first thing we must do is login. We have a Postman section to handle the Login/Logout to your VCSA Appliance. This will provide us the session authorization we need to move forward and proceed with the updates.\n    Checking for Updates When it comes to checking for updates, we can either check locally or locally and online in this example my VCSA has access to the internet so I will navigate to the Check vCenter Server Update - URL \u0026amp; CD-ROM section and Send this request to our VCSA. Once it finishes we will be provided the details of all pending updates. It will let us know the same values available in the UI such as the severity, release date, version and more.\n    The next few requests utilize a variable called version to populate this variable it is quite easy using Postman. If we highlight the version that was returned. We can right-click and for our environment we can set it for the version variable.\n    Checking the Update Details We will next review the vCenter Server Update - Version Details request. This will get details for the specific version update such as the name, version, priority and impact to the vCenter Server such as do services need to be restarted or does the appliance need to be rebooted.\n    Staging the Update Prior to installing any update they must be staged, we do have the ability to stage and install the update in one workflow, but I want to explorer the API\u0026rsquo;s available for staging the patch. The sample requests provide the ability to stage the update, get information on the staged update and delete the staged update.\n    Please note that when the update is staged the request will be complete but the update may not be fully staged yet. You can check the status of the staged update by using the vCenter Server Update - Status request. We can see below the Staging is in Progress\n    Now that the Update is staged we can see that the state is UPDATES_PENDING with the version that is staged.\n    Installing the Update When it comes to installing an update we will follow the workflow of precheck, validate and install. A feature that is included as part of the installation process is the ability to do a precheck. When executed it will review the VCSA details and provide any warnings or errors as well as the estimated time for the update to install.\n    If we previously staged our update we can run the vCenter Server Update - Install request, if we have not previously staged the update we will use the vCenter Server Update - Stage and Install. As soon as we hit send, the update starts but we will not be given any status.\nTo check the status of the update we will go back to the vCenter Server Update - Status request and execute it. Since the update does stop and restart services initially you might get a 503 service unavailable or be prompted to log back in and this is ok. If you wish to keep tabs on the update process keep sending the request to check for updates and login again if needed.\nWe can see that the API is now available again and the Update is in progress.\n    When it is complete we will see the state is UP_TO_DATE and our VCSA update is now complete.\n    Conclusion Using the REST API\u0026rsquo;s does not have to be hard especially when tied in with pre-built sample resources such as Postman requests. Hopefully this has been helpful for you to start the patching of your VCSA using the REST API\u0026rsquo;s.\nIf you have any questions feel free to reach out here or on twitter @davidstamen\n","permalink":"https://davidstamen.com/2018/12/20/patching-the-vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa-using-the-rest-api/","tags":["vSphere 6.7","REST API","vCenter Server"],"title":"Patching the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) using the REST API - Part 1 (Postman Collection)"},{"categories":["VMware"],"contents":"When trying to update your vSphere 6.5 environment to vSphere 6.5u2d it may show that there are no available updates.\nWhen you check for updates whether using the URL or CD-ROM Repository you may see Latest updates already installed on vCSA, Nothing to stage/install\n    This issue is due to the method the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) 6.5 update feature processes build numbering prior to VCSA 6.5 U1d.

If you have used 6.7 GA you may have noticed the Auto Deploy functionality did not yet make it into the long awaited vSphere Client. With vCenter Server 6.7 U1 we now have feature parity and this means Auto Deploy has been added to the vSphere Client. Lets jump in and see some of the new functionality that has been included.\nWhat is Auto Deploy? For those who may not be familiar with Auto Deploy I will give a brief overview on it. Auto Deploy allows you to utilize vCenter Server, a TFTP Server and Network Boot to automatically have hosts boot or install ESXi.\nThere are 3 types of Auto Deploy:\n Stateless - This feature allows you to have a host re-provisioned on each the hosts is rebooted with Auto Deploy. Stateless Caching – This feature allows you to cache the host\u0026rsquo;s image locally on the host or on a usb drive and continue to provision the host with Auto Deploy. Stateful Installs – This feature allows you to install hosts over the network without setting up a complete PXE boot infrastructure. After the initial network boot, these hosts boot like other hosts on which ESXi is installed.  More information on installing hosts using Auto Deploy can be found here.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s New with Auto Deploy There have not been any major changes with Auto Deploy in vSphere 6.7 outside of some bug fixes and performance improvements, but 6.7 U1 included an updated workflow to manage Auto Deploy in the vSphere Client so let\u0026rsquo;s check out the new interface and see how we can configure Auto Deploy using the new interface.\nWe can now enable Auto Deploy and Image Builder in One-Click. No longer do we need to go into the services and edit the startup policy, and start the services.\n    When utilizing an Online Depot we can easily check for updates, view the software packages, image profiles and even export them as needed to be used in an offline software depot.\n    The workflow to create a deploy rule has also been simplified and can easily see patterns to add or use the default setting of all hosts.\n    We can also see the current deploy rules and choose to activate or deactivate and test them before activation\n    Conclusion So far I have loved using the vSphere Client as it has improved on many tasks we do as a VMware Administrator. Bringing all the configuration into a single UI also makes Auto Deploy easier to manage. Hopefully this has helped highlight some of the changes in vSphere 6.7 U1. Please reach out to me with any feedback!\n","permalink":"https://davidstamen.com/2018/10/18/whats-new-with-auto-deploy-in-vsphere-6.7-u1/","tags":["Lifecycle","AutoDeploy","vSphere 6.7"],"title":"What's New with Auto Deploy in vSphere 6.7 U1"},{"categories":["VMware"],"contents":"vSphere 6.7 Update 1 is finally here! Lets jump in and find out how and why to upgrade!\nWhy should I upgrade to vSphere 6.7 Update 1? vSphere 6.7 Update 1 has been a much anticipated release, it has many features folks have been waiting for some time. To highlight a few we now have a converge tool to migrate from an External PSC topology to an Embedded PSC topology, we now have a 100% Parity HTML-5 vSphere Client and more\u0026hellip;. My colleague Emad Younis has a great rundown on the new vSphere 6.7 Update 1 features.\nHow do I upgrade my vSphere Environment to vSphere 6.7 Update 1? Actually upgrading to vSphere 6.7 Update 1 can be quite easy, but we don\u0026rsquo;t just want to jump into the upgrade. We want to make sure we do some planning prior to performing our upgrade.\nPlanning for your vSphere Upgrade to vSphere 6.7 Update 1 Before we even begin to look at how to upgrade we need to make sure we don\u0026rsquo;t have any roadblocks that will stop us from upgrading. First, we want to review the vCenter Server 6.7 Update 1 and ESXi 6.7 Update 1 release notes.\nWhen reviewing the vCenter Server release notes we want to pay close attention to the Installation and Upgrade Notes for This Release section as we would highlight any blocked paths such as upgrading from vSphere 6.5 Update 2 to vSphere 6.7 GA. We also want to review the known issues section of the release notes to make sure that none of the current known issues would impact us once we have upgraded.\nOnce we have validated that we do not have any blockers to upgrade the next thing we want to do is validate compatibility. We need to validate with our 3rd party solutions such as backup, monitoring, security tools are compatible to the release are moving to. We also need to review the VMware Product Interoperability Matrices to make sure our VMware Products are Interoperable and we have a supported upgrade path as well. Last but not least we need to validate our hardware against the VMware Compatibility Guide or the ESXi Compatibility Checker Fling.\nIf we are using multiple VMware products and some are in need of upgrade we want to consult KB53710 which will tell us the update sequence for vSphere 6.7 and its compatible products. A key consideration here is that vCenter Server is actually #8 on the list so quite a few products may need to be upgraded prior to starting your core vSphere Upgrade.\nOne last thing to consider when planning your upgrade to vSphere 6.7 Update 1 is your deployment topology. With vSphere 6.5 Update 2 and vSphere 6.7 we now support Enhanced LInked Mode for Embedded vCenter Server deployments. However, this was only available for greenfield or expanded deployments. With vSphere 6.7 Update 1 we now include a converge tool that will allow you to migrate from an External PSC vCenter Server deployment to an Embedded PSC vCenter Server deployment. This is done as a post upgrade task and requires all PSC and vCenter Servers within the SSO domain to be upgraded to vSphere 6.7 Update 1 first.\nOnce we have reviewed and planned our upgrade we can now begin to actually perform our upgrade.\nPerforming your vSphere Upgrade to vSphere 6.7 Update 1 I covered the actual upgrade process in this blog series on Automating your vSphere Upgrade but we want to cover the specifics of upgrading to vSphere 6.7 Update 1.\nBefore starting our actual upgrade we want to make sure to backup our vCenter Server whether it is with the file-based backup or an image-based backup.\nPSC / vCenter Server There is no in-place upgrade to upgrade from 6.0 or 6.5, whether you are doing a migration (windows to vcsa) or upgrade (vcsa to vcsa) the process is the same, when utilizing the vCenter Server Appliance installer to upgrade we deploy a brand new vSphere 6.7 U1 appliance and then export and import the data. Do NOT try to attach the 6.7 U1 iso to your 6.0/6.5 appliance and upgrade in place as it will not work.\nWhen upgrading from vSphere 6.7 to 6.7 U1 this can be done through the vCenter Appliance Management Interface (VAMI). Please excercise caution when applying updates as folks may not realize that when going this route a major release could be occuring as it shows up as just a patch. This is where the planning stages we mentioned above come into place. The upgrade from vSphere 6.7 to 6.7 U1 is done as in-place upgrade so make sure you understand the upgrade plan depending on which version you are upgrading from.\nYou can find more information on upgrading your PSC/vCenter Server here.\nESXi Hosts As far as your ESXi hosts go, we do have a supported upgrade path to do an in-place upgrade. Doing some workshops with customers I have heard that in the past they have opted to not use vSphere Update Manager (VUM) and choose to either rebuild or attach the ISO manually and upgrade and this is definitely not ideal!\nThe recommended approach to upgrade your ESXi Hosts should be to utilize VUM to import the ESXi 6.7 U1 image, then create an upgrade baseline and remediate your cluster. This allows VUM to orchestrate the upgrades of the vCenter Server clusters and patch 1 host at a time without any impact to your running guests\nYou can find more information on upgrading your ESXi Hosts here.\nVM Tools / VM Compatibility Once your ESXi hosts have been updated to 6.7 U1 you may see that there are newer versions of tools available as well as a newer version of VM Compatibility (v14). VMware Tools should always be updated to the latest version, however when it comes to VM Compatibility we recomend only upgrading it when newer features need to be exposed. At a minimum you should be running v11 to protect against Spectre/Meltdown and only upgrading to v14 if you need features such as VBS, vTPM or Per-VM EVC.\nYou can find more information on upgrading your Virtual Machines here.\nConclusion When upgrading your vSphere environment, it does not help to rush and upgrade as soon as you can. To execute a successful upgrade it takes some planning to make sure you wont have any issues and need to rollback. Hopefully this has helped you and if you have any questions leave them below!\n","permalink":"https://davidstamen.com/2018/10/11/why-and-how-to-upgrade-to-vsphere-6.7-u1/","tags":["vSphere Upgrade","vSphere 6.7"],"title":"Why and How To Upgrade to vSphere 6.7 U1"},{"categories":["VMware"],"contents":"We are on the home stretch of our Automating your vSphere Upgrade blog series. The final step of completing our upgrade will be upgrading our Virtual Distributed Switch (VDS). When upgrading your VDS on vSphere 6.7 the version is actually 6.6 (we will cover the details later). Please make sure prior to upgrading your VDS to 6.6 all ESXi hosts have been upgraded to ESXi 6.7, if you still have hosts on ESXi 6.5 you will only be able to upgrade to version 6.5.\n    Considerations for Upgrading your Virtual Distributed Switch The first consideration we would like to think about is why would I want to upgrade my VDS? Well if you had previously upgraded from vSphere 5.5 your VDS still may be on version 5.5 and this is not compatible with vSphere 6.7. Another reason is that we can review the new features that are listed below, we can see this when we click on the (i**)** within the VDS GUI. We can see that upgrading to version 6.0 gets us NIOC v3 and IGMP/MLD snooping, version 6.5 gives us port mirroring enhancements and version 6.6 gets us mac learning. If you run any nested virtualization in your environment this is a great enhancement as we no longer require you to enable promiscuous mode on your VM port group.\n    Another consideration I like to recommend is that you keep your VDS upgraded to the same version as your ESXi hosts whenever possible. Previously in most vSphere versions it has always been said that upgrading your VDS can be done at anytime and is a non-disruptive upgrade., but we always want to use caution and do this within a maintenance window. The VDS upgrade is also something that has no rollback, once it is complete it is permanent unless you have completed a backup. With vSphere 6.7 and the introduction of VDS version 6.6 there are some known issues and considerations I want to mention prior to getting started upgrading our switch. A question I get asked quite frequently is why is vSphere 6.7\u0026rsquo;s VDS version 6.6? The answer is quite simple, VMware on AWS (VMC) shares quite a bit of the same code as vSphere On-Perm and since there were no major changes to the VDS features or functionality the version stayed the same. Prior to upgrading our VDS version to 6.6 we definitely want to make sure we review KB52621. This KB covers considerations around known issues upgrading to version 6.6. Some of these considerations are making sure to put DRS into partially automated mode since if a vMotion occurs during the upgrade the VDS upgrade will fail. To take these considerations into account, we will make sure to include this in our Upgrading your Virtual Distributed Switch automation. Prior to upgrading we also need to verify that all hosts have been upgraded to vSphere 6.7 so we do not have any errors. If there is a incompatible host attached the upgrade will not be allowed to proceed. To validate our ESXi host version for all hosts attached to our VDS we can do so as follows.\n1Get-VDSwitch \u0026#34;VDS\u0026#34;|Get-VMHost|Select Name, Version|Sort Name      We can see here that one of our hosts is not upgraded to 6.7 so if we were to proceed with upgrading our VDS it would fail. Before we proceed on to our next section we will make sure to upgrade our ESXi host to vSphere 6.7. If we were to attempt to upgrade our VDS prior to upgrading we would have encountered an error such as below.\n    Upgrading your Virtual Distributed Switch Now that we are ready to move forward with upgrading our VDS, we will take some of the above considerations into place. Since we know if a vMotion is occurring during upgrade it will fail. We will make sure that if DRS is enabled we will put it into Partially Automated mode. Also, since we know we cannot rollback from a version upgrade we will make sure to take a backup prior to our upgrade. Unlike our previous blogs where we used simple one-liners, we will utilize a bit more logic in this upgrade that will be required as a script. As an introduction to the below script we will outline what it does. At the top we define variables for the VDS Name, Version we wish to upgrade to and the cluster(s) in which the VDS is attached. We will then check if DRS is enabled on the vSphere Cluster. If DRS is enabled we will store the current DRS Automation level and set it to Partially Automated, Backup the VDS, Upgrade the VDS and then we will restore the DRS Level back to the original state. If DRS is disabled, we perform a Backup of the VDS and then Upgrade the VDS. You can see the code below and grab the script from GitHub.\n1Connect-VIServer \u0026#34;ds-vcsa-03.cpbu.lab\u0026#34; | Out-Null 2$VDSwitch = \u0026#34;VDS\u0026#34; 3$VDVersion = \u0026#34;6.6.0\u0026#34; 4$Cluster = Get-Cluster \u0026#34;Cluster\u0026#34; 5 6If ($Cluster.DrsEnabled -like \u0026#34;True\u0026#34;) { 7 Write-Host \u0026#34;DRS is Enabled, it will be temporarily disabled during upgrade.\u0026#34; -ForegroundColor \u0026#34;Green\u0026#34; 8 $ClusterDRSLevel = $Cluster.DrsAutomationLevel 9 Write-Host \u0026#34;DRS Cluster is currently set to $ClusterDRSLevel.

Even though the upgrade is itself a simple one-liner:\n1(Get-VDSwitch -Name $VDSwitch | Set-VDSwitch -Version $VDVersion) We can automate the pre-requisites, backups and considerations to make this a more seamless upgrade. If you are interested in understanding how you can upgrade your VDS through the UI please see my colleague Nigel Hickeys blog here.\nYou can find more information on Backing Up and Restoring your VDS here and more information on Upgrading your Virtual Distributed Switch here.\nConclusion As we have now completed Automating our vSphere Upgrade we can see it wasn’t so bad after all. Im hoping this series has helped you better understand what it takes to Automate your vSphere Upgrade and for those of you with large environments it gives you an idea on how you can start to streamline the upgrades across your entire vSphere environment.\n Cross-Posted from vSphere Blog\nhttps://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2018/10/automating-upgrade-of-virtual-distributed-switch.html\n","permalink":"https://davidstamen.com/2018/10/08/automating-the-upgrade-of-the-virtual-distributed-switch/","tags":["vSphere Upgrade","Networking","VDS"],"title":"Automating the Upgrade of the Virtual Distributed Switch"},{"categories":["VMware"],"contents":"Next up in our Automating your vSphere Upgrade blog series is your VMFS Datastore. vSphere 6.5 and vSphere 6.7 both support the latest VMFS-6. Once all of your ESXi hosts that are connected to the VMFS-5 datastore have been upgraded to vSphere 6.5 or vSphere 6.7 you can then proceed to migrate your datastore to VMFS-6.\n     Please note that vSphere 6.7 no longer supports VMFS-3. Prior to upgrading your ESXi host you should do an upgrade from VMFS-3 to VMFS-5 or they will be upgraded automatically during the Host upgrade.\n Migrating from VMFS-5 to VMFS-6 When we start our migration of our datastore\u0026rsquo;s to VMFS-6 you may be wondering… Do I need to? What are the benefits? As we can see below graphic there was quite a few enhancements in support for Automatic Space Reclamation, In-Guest Space Reclamation and native support for 4K native storage.\n    You will also see that we have mentioned migrating from VMFS-5 to VMFS-6. Due to the underlying storage changes to support 4K Native storage as well as other features the metadata has changed and the upgrade cannot be done In-Place. The migration requires you to delete the current datastore and re-create. In a later section we will cover how to automate this process.\nYou can find out more information on vSphere 6.7 Storage enhancements here.\nChecking Current VMFS Version In case you are not sure what VMFS version your datastore is currently running, we can find out with a simple PowerCLI one-liner.\n1Get-Datastore | Select Name, FileSystemVersion      Here we can see that DS01 is still at VMFS-5 and DS02 has already been upgraded to VMFS-6. In the next section we will target upgrading our datastore to VMFS-6.\nUpdating VMFS Version When it comes to migrating to VMFS-6 we have a few methods. A good reference to use is KB2147924, this KB covers the supported methods and ways to update your VMFS version. My colleague Nigel Hickey has covered how to do GUI based upgrades of VMFS. However, when you have many datastore\u0026rsquo;s it may help to automate this process.\nAs we reference the above KB it mentions a PowerCLI cmdlet called Update-VMFSDatastore. This is an powerful tool that acts a bit different than your standard PowerCLI cmdlet, it is very verbose and detailed with the checks that it does. However, there are also some considerations to take into account when using it.\nA few considerations when using it are as follows:\n Requires use of datastore cluster and have a temporary VMFS-5 datastore of equal or greater capacity. Issues storage vMotion requests to the temporary datastore. Validates that no unsupported VMs exist on the datastore such as those with SRM, VADP, VRM or Clustering. Will temporarily disable Storage DRS and enable once complete.  If cmdlet fails enabling storage DRS is a manual effort.   Carefully review the usage of the Resume and Rollback parameters in case of any errors.  So now that we know some things to look out for what does the cmdlet actually do?\n Checks for VADP, SMPFT, MSCS/RAC virtual machines on Source Datastore. Makes sure datastore is accessible to all hosts. Validates Temporary datastore has sufficient capacity. Modifies Storage DRS Automation to manual Moves VM and orphaned data from Source to Temp datastore. Unmount Source Datastore Recreate Source Datastore as VMFS-6 Moves VM and orphaned data from Temp to Source datastore. Restores Original Storage DRS setting.  Now that we understand how it works, lets jump into the usage.\n1Connect-VIServer ds-vcsa-03.cpbu.lab 2 3$Source = Get-Datastore \u0026#34;DS02\u0026#34; 4$Temp = Get-Datastore \u0026#34;DS-TEMP\u0026#34; 5$Server = (Get-VIServer -Server \u0026#34;ds-vcsa-03.cpbu.lab\u0026#34;) 6 7Update-VmfsDatastore -Datastore $Source -TemporaryDatastore $Temp -TargetVmfsVersion \u0026#34;6\u0026#34; -Server $Server It requires very minimal input, we will put in the source datastore, the temporary datastore, vCenter Server and the Target VMFS version.     The above animated gif will show the process. It is quite simple and if you encounter errors they will be logged and you can rollback using the rollback parameter of if the error can resumed you can use the resume parameter.\nYou can see more information on the usage of Update-VMFSDatastore at the PowerCLI Reference.\nConclusion It is always great to see some native tools to assist us in accomplishing complicated tasks. For those who have an abundance of datastore\u0026rsquo;s in their environment, this cmdlet can save quite a bit of time. If you have used it, leave some feedback on your thoughts. Next up on our series will be Automating Your Virtual Distributed Switch upgrade.\n Cross-Posted from vSphere Blog\nhttps://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2018/10/automating-migration-of-vmfs-5-to-vmfs-6-datastores.html\n","permalink":"https://davidstamen.com/2018/10/07/automating-migration-of-vmfs-5-to-vmfs-6-datastores/","tags":["vSphere Upgrade","Storage"],"title":"Automating Migration of VMFS-5 to VMFS-6 Datastores"},{"categories":["VMware"],"contents":"Next up in our Automating your vSphere Upgrade blog series is your VMware Tools and VM Compatibility. Upgrading these both have different requirements so we will cover when and how you should upgrade your VMware Tools and VM compatibility in the below post.\n    Upgrading VMware Tools When it comes to keeping your VMware Tools up to date we have a few options but I will focus on two of my favorite methods. Keeping VMware tools up to date is very important as VMware includes drivers and tools to make sure your VM\u0026rsquo;s run optimally with the latest features. Eric Gray of our CPBU Technical Marketing Team covers a few considerations and methods in depth in the following blog post Six Methods for Keeping VM Tools Up to Date.\nChecking VMware Tools Compliance Before we can start to update our VMware Tools it might be a good idea to understand which VMs in our environment are currently out of compliance, the easiest way to check if a VM if out of compliance is to view it via the vSphere Client and it will show you details such as the version and compliance.\n    However, since we are talking about automation lets show this another way using PowerCLI.\n1Get-Folder -name Testing | Get-VM | % { get-view $\\_.id } | select name, @{Name=“ToolsVersion”; Expression={$\\_.config.tools.toolsversion}}, @{ Name=“ToolStatus”; Expression={$\\_.Guest.ToolsVersionStatus}}|Sort-Object Name Using this PowerCLI one-liner we are able to see more information at scale, we can see that within our folder we actually have 3 VMs that are out of compliance. To remediate these to the latest version its actually quite simple with PowerCLI as well.     To make the information clearer on what needs an update we will use the same search only looking for VMs where ToolStatus is guestToolsNeedUpgrade. To do that we will use the following one-liner.\n1Get-Folder -name Testing | Get-VM | % { get-view $\\_.id } |Where-Object {$\\_.Guest.ToolsVersionStatus -like \u0026#34;guestToolsNeedUpgrade\u0026#34;} |select name, @{Name=“ToolsVersion”; Expression={$\\_.config.tools.toolsversion}}, @{ Name=“ToolStatus”; Expression={$\\_.Guest.ToolsVersionStatus}}| Sort-Object Name      Upgrading VMware Tools via PowerCLI Now that we know which VMs need tools update we can actually go forth and upgrade tools. That is quite simple we can do this using the Update-Tools PowerCLI cmdlet. Using our existing one-liner from above we will just append Update-Tools to update the VMs with tools currently out of compliance.\n1Get-Folder -name Testing | Get-VM | % { get-view $\\_.id } |Where-Object {$\\_.Guest.ToolsVersionStatus -like \u0026#34;guestToolsNeedUpgrade\u0026#34;} |select name, @{Name=“ToolsVersion”; Expression={$\\_.config.tools.toolsversion}}, @{ Name=“ToolStatus”; Expression={$\\_.Guest.ToolsVersionStatus}}| Update-Tools -NoReboot -VM {$\\_.Name} -Verbose      You may have noticed that all the VMs had their updates kicked off at the same time and this may not be ideal, this is one way that the Update-Tools cmdlet works, however we can get around this by storing the VMs within a variable and then using a loop process them one at a time. This is definitely preferable as it will limit the impact to the environment.\n1$OutofDateVMs = Get-Folder -name Testing | Get-VM | % { get-view $\\_.id } |Where-Object {$\\_.Guest.ToolsVersionStatus -like \u0026#34;guestToolsNeedUpgrade\u0026#34;} |select name, @{Name=“ToolsVersion”; Expression={$\\_.config.tools.toolsversion}}, @{ Name=“ToolStatus”; Expression={$\\_.Guest.ToolsVersionStatus}} 2 3ForEach ($VM in $OutOfDateVMs){Update-Tools -NoReboot -VM $VM.Name -Verbose}      Now our tools are up to date! For more information on upgrading your VMware Tools via PowerCLI you can find more information here. Upgrading Tools Automatically on Reboot Using VM options to keep VMware Tools up to date is also another method to automatically keep VMs up to date. Enabling the \u0026ldquo;Check and upgrade VMware Tools before each power on\u0026rdquo; advanced setting use to not be used because of the additional reboot it would cause for virtual machines. Keep in mind that with Windows Server 2016 VMware Tools no longer need a reboot on upgrade, it can be safe to enable this setting and have VMs stay up to date on every reboot. However this may not be applicable to all situations, so another recommendation would be to enable this for a lab environment or non-critical workloads. The easy way to enable this option is to log into the vSphere Client, edit the VM settings and enable the setting.\n    After all this a post on automation, so lets see if we can find a way to use PowerCLI to modify the VM\u0026rsquo;s setting so this gets easier when we have a large environment.\n1Get-Folder Testing|Get-VM|Get-View | select name,@{N=\u0026#39;ToolsUpgradePolicy\u0026#39;;E={$\\_.Config.Tools.ToolsUpgradePolicy } } |Sort Name      Here we can see which VMs have the automatic upgrade set and which ones are configured for manual. Utilizing a filter we can look for objects that are set for manual and then configure them to be set for upgradeAtPowerCycle\n1$ManualUpdateVMs = Get-Folder Testing|Get-VM|Get-View | Where-Object {$\\_.Config.Tools.ToolsUpgradePolicy -like \u0026#34;manual\u0026#34;}|select name,@{N=\u0026#39;ToolsUpgradePolicy\u0026#39;;E={$\\_.Config.Tools.ToolsUpgradePolicy } } 2 3Foreach ($VM in ($ManualUpdateVMs)) { 4$VMConfig = Get-View -VIObject $VM.Name 5$vmConfigSpec = New-Object VMware.Vim.VirtualMachineConfigSpec 6$vmConfigSpec.Tools = New-Object VMware.Vim.ToolsConfigInfo 7$vmConfigSpec.Tools.ToolsUpgradePolicy = \u0026#34;UpgradeAtPowerCycle\u0026#34; 8$VMConfig.ReconfigVM($vmConfigSpec) 9}      If we do a final check we can see that all VMs are now set to upgradeAtPowerCycle.\n    Upgrading VM Compatibility When it comes to upgrading your VM Compatibility this is something that should be done with caution. Upgrading VM Compatibility aka VM Hardware is like pulling out the motherboard and replacing it with a new one, so this should only be done when features and functionality in a higher level are needed. Our current recommended level is Hardware Version 11 as it handles remediation from current security threats. Prior to upgrading your VM Compatibility you should always make sure VMware Tools are up to date first as new drivers can be required for the new virtual hardware. As I mentioned previously prior to upgrading your VM Compatibility I recommend taking a snapshot or a backup of the virtual machine in case a rollback is needed. Checking VM Compatibility Version Its quite easy to see the current version of VM Compatibility via the vSphere Client, however when checking the current levels across our entire vCenter Server we may want to automate this Below you will find a quick and easy one-liner to identify the VMs and their current VM Compatibility version.\n1Get-folder Testing | Get-VM | Select Name, Version | Sort Name      As we can see above a few VMs are currently running v14 which is compatible with vSphere 6.7 only. This was needed for us to take advantage of VBS and TPM security features. Again, we should only upgrade VM Compatibility when additional functionality is needed.\nUpgrading VM Compatibility Version We have identified a need to upgrade VM08 also to v14 to take advantage of Per-VM EVC so we can handle the automation of the VM compatibility upgrade. We can do this again quite easily with PowerCLI. If you wish to do this via the vSphere Client my colleague Nigel Hickey covers this in his blog series here. However, we are talking automation here so lets jump into the quick script to accomplish this.\n1$HardwareUpdateVMs = Get-Folder Testing | Get-VM VM08 2 3Foreach ($VM in ($HardwareUpdateVMs)) { 4$VMConfig = Get-View -VIObject $VM.Name 5$vmConfigSpec = New-Object VMware.Vim.VirtualMachineConfigSpec 6$vmConfigSpec.ScheduledHardwareUpgradeInfo = New-Object -TypeName VMware.Vim.ScheduledHardwareUpgradeInfo 7$vmConfigSpec.ScheduledHardwareUpgradeInfo.UpgradePolicy = “always” 8$vmConfigSpec.ScheduledHardwareUpgradeInfo.VersionKey = “vmx-14” 9$VMConfig.ReconfigVM($vmConfigSpec) 10}      This will not automatically upgrade the VM Compatibility, unlike VMware Tools this can not be done with the virtual machine Powered On. The next time the VM is rebooted it will be shutdown, the compatibility will be upgraded and then be powered back on.\nMore information on upgrading VM Compatibility can be found here.\nConclusion Automating your VMware Tools and VM Compatibility upgrades do not need to be hard, we have quite a few ways to help you with this and help this blog has helped educate you on some additional methods. For more information on Automating your vSphere Upgrade be sure to check out the full series here.\n Cross-Posted from vSphere Blog\nhttps://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2018/09/automating-upgrade-of-vmware-tools-and-vmware-compatibility.html\n","permalink":"https://davidstamen.com/2018/10/06/automating-upgrade-of-vmware-tools-and-vm-compatibility/","tags":["vSphere Upgrade","VM Tools","VM Compatibility"],"title":"Automating Upgrade of VMware Tools and VM Compatibility"},{"categories":["VMware"],"contents":"The first topic we will cover in our Automating your vSphere Upgrade series is updating our core infrastructure. Upgrading Platform Services Controller(PSC) and vCenter Server via the CLI installer. In our workshops one of the common things I hear is that most folks aren\u0026rsquo;t using the CLI based tools that have been included in the installer. I am a huge fan of these as they make migrations and upgrades seamless\u0026ndash;especially when having to perform the task if you have multiple PSC\u0026rsquo;s and vCenter Servers. Using the CLI tools don’t have to be intimidating, as we go through this blog we will cover some how-to\u0026rsquo;s and benefits of using the CLI based approach.\n    When we start our vSphere Upgrade the first thing we want to do is to upgrade our PSC and vCenter Server before updating other components. If we happen to be using an Embedded PSC deployment the upgrade is simple, we can do the upgrade in one step (Step 1 and Step 2 combined). However, if we are using an External PSC deployment we must upgrade all of our PSC\u0026rsquo;s within the same SSO domain first prior to upgrading any vCenter Servers\u0026ndash;so this becomes a multi-step process.\n    For this upgrade scenario we will be performing an upgrade from an External PSC deployment using appliances on vSphere 6.0 to an External PSC deployment using appliances on vSphere 6.7.\nPrepare Your JSON Configuration File for CLI Upgrade When doing a CLI based upgrade, we use a configuration file template (JSON) that is part of the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) ISO. When you mount the ISO you will see a directory labelled vcsa-cli-installer and within that folder is a directory called templates. Once you are here you have the option to see the CLI templates for install, migrate and upgrade. As a reminder a migration is when we are moving from a vCenter Server on Windows, and an upgrade is when we are moving from VCSA to VCSA.\nSince we are doing an upgrade we will browse to that folder and we are left seeing a vcsa6.0 and vcsa6.5 directory. The information we need when coming from each version is different so there is a unique set of templates for each version. Since we are upgrading from a vSphere 6.0 deployment we will head into the vcsa6.0 directory.\nOnce we are in this directory we can see a few different templates. We have a template for an embedded deployment, external PSC and external vCenter Server. Each template has an associated version whether or not we will be connecting to a vCenter Server or an ESXi host directly. The embedded template is for an embedded deployment which does both PSC and vCenter Server at the same time as we mentioned above, and the PSC and VCSA are separate templates as we need to do these one at a time.\n    Since we have an External PSC deployment and we are using a vCenter Server, we will first open the PSC_on_VC.json.\n    When opening this file at first glance you might say WOAH! That looks complicated, but there is quite a bit of extra text explaining each field. Lets fill in the blanks with the required information and take another look.\n    This looks a lot better, we can clearly see the details it is asking for. The vCenter Server to deploy the new appliance to, the appliance information, the temporary IP to use, and then last but not least the source information for the appliance we are upgrading. If we have a deployment where there are multiple PSC\u0026rsquo;s we could see how easy it would be to make a copy of this file, and edit lines 17 and 41 putting in the second PSC and then re-saving. How much time saving could this be!? With vSphere 6.5 allowing 10 PSC\u0026rsquo;s per SSO domain and vSphere 6.7 allowing 15 this could be quite a bit of time saved!\nNext up, its time to upgrade our vCenter Server. To get our JSON file ready we will head back and grab the vCSA_on_VC.json template. Also remember that if you happen to have multiple VCSA\u0026rsquo;s to upgrade you can easily update lines 16 ,17 and 40 to upgrade other appliances in your environment.\n     Certain sensitive fields such as passwords can be left blank if chosen. When the CLI installer is run it will prompt for the password during runtime.\n Now that we have prepared our templates for our upgrade, the next section we will jump into how to actually perform our upgrade using the CLI. More information on preparing the JSON template can be found here.\nUpgrade a vCenter Server Appliance or Platform Services Controller Appliance by Using the CLI CLI templates in hand, its now for the fun. Using these templates we will automate our upgrade. vSphere 6.0 originally introduced this concept of a CLI based tool, however its been enhanced with vSphere 6.7. With vSphere 6.7 we now have a \u0026ldquo;batch template\u0026rdquo; technology built into the installer. Prior to vSphere 6.7 we had to run the installer against a single JSON file and wait for it to finish, we would then have to manually kick off the second JSON file when the previous one completes. With the batch upgrade we can put multiple JSON files into a single directory and point the installer to the directory and it is smart enough to map out the dependencies and upgrade the PSC\u0026rsquo;s first and then the vCenter Servers.\nBefore we actually perform our upgrade, I want to explain some of the benefits of the CLI installer. If we happened to be using the GUI based upgrade, everything in that upgrade would have to be manually entered into the GUI and obviously that is susceptible to typos and errors. Also, if we happened to enter some incorrect information and had to retry our upgrade we would again have to re-type all that information. What if we had a way to perform an upgrade test without ever touching our production environment? With the CLI Installer we do! And its called a pre-check. When running the CLI installer with the --precheck-only flag we have the ability to go through a full dry run of our upgrade. If we happened to have a typo, insufficient capacity or any other errors it would spit this out, and we could easily correct the settings.\nTo run our CLI based installer we will mount our vSphere 6.7 media as that is the version we are going to. We will again navigate to the vcsa-cli-installer directory. From here depending on the operating system of the machine we are on we will either navigate to the lin64, win32 or mac folder to use the supported installer for that operating system.\nHere we will see quite a few files, but the one we want to focus on is vcsa-deploy.exe in the win32 folder since I will be running this from a windows machine. If we run .\\vcsa-deploy.exe upgrade it will give us the details on how to properly use the CLI tool.\n    As I mentioned previously one of the benefits of using the CLI tool is that you can execute a pre-check of your template against the environment to make sure things will pass. Usually with upgrades and migrations a big issue we see with them failing is due to a smaller appliance size being chosen for the new appliance or insufficient capacity in the vCenter Server environment. In this environment we will execute our vcsa-deploy utilizing the pre-check option and see our results.\nTo run the pre-check I ran the following command: .\\vcsa-deploy.exe upgrade --no-ssl-certificate-verification --accept-eula --acknowledge-ceip --precheck-only C:\\scripts\\\\6.7\\upg60to67\\\nI chose to point this to the folder to take advantage of the batch upgrade vs pointing it to the individual file, as I mentioned earlier it is smart enough to map out the dependencies as we can see from the below image.\n    Once the pre-check runs through we will either get a success or failure. In the image below my vCenter Server services were not running so the pre-check failed.\n    Now that we have the service running and re-run our pre-check we can see everything is successful and we can now proceed to remove the \u0026ndash;precheck-only flag from our command.\n    .\\vcsa-deploy.exe** **upgrade --no-ssl-certificate-verification --accept-eula --acknowledge-ceip C:\\scripts\\\\6.7\\upg60to67\\\nThe upgrade process is now happening without any additional user input. If you need to step away for lunch or if a co-worker needs you there is no additional action that is needed until the end. If you were using the GUI based approach once Stage 1 where the appliance is deployed is complete you have to manually start Stage 2 to configure the upgraded appliance. With the CLI based installer this is not needed. When our upgrade is complete we will be presented with the vCenter Server and login information as we can see below.\n    More information on Upgrading your PSC and vCenter Server via the CLI can be found here.\nConclusion Automating your vSphere Upgrade does not have to be scary or hard, as we went through the steps its actually quite easy. Now that we have our PSC and vCenter Server updated we can now proceed to our next step which is automating the upgrade of our ESXi hosts.\n Cross-Posted from vSphere Blog\nhttps://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2018/09/upgrading-platform-services-controller-and-vcenter-server-via-the-cli-installer.html\n","permalink":"https://davidstamen.com/2018/10/05/upgrading-platform-services-controller-and-vcenter-server-via-the-cli-installer/","tags":["vSphere Upgrade","vSphere 6.5","vSphere 6.7","PSC","vCenter Server"],"title":"Upgrading Platform Services Controller and vCenter Server via the CLI Installer"},{"categories":["VMware","Security"],"contents":"On Tuesday August 14th, Intel Released their news on the latest vulnerability L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF) or ForeShadow.

I\u0026rsquo;ve been using 6.7 through the vSphere Beta Program and testing even newer features in my current role. I am here to talk to you about planning your vSphere upgrade and some planning and considerations you should have when going to the latest release.\nThe first, thing I would like to mention is there is no supported migration from vSphere 5.x to 6.7. You must be running vSphere 6.0 or 6.5.\nAs we did with 6.5 and even more with 6.7 we are now calling the vCenter Server Appliance the default deployment. Why you ask? Well vSphere 6.7 is now the last release to support the Windows installer. So if you happened to upgrade to 6.5 and are still on Windows, you now have a supported upgrade path to the appliance on vSphere 6.7.\nSome key considerations with changed topologies as well. We now support Enhanced Link Mode (ELM) with embedded deployments. This means if you have a greenfield deployment, where you have 1 embedded deployment, you can now deploy a second embedded deployment and use ELM. However if you currently have two 6.0/6.5 embedded deployments in separate SSO domains and wish to upgrade to 6.7, there is no way yet to use ELM.\nAnother considerations is we have removed what we called sites within SSO domains, this means there is now a lot more flexibility when planning your Platform Services Controller topology. With 6.7 we have enhanced the cmsso-util utility where you now can repoint to a PSC within the same SSO or across sites. You also now have the ability to repoint across SSO domains, so this will definitely help with consolidating environments (external PSC deployments only).\nAnd of course, if you are already on vSphere 6.5 an wondering why should I go to 6.7?

So towards the end of the year I kind of slacked on writing some blog posts, when I finally did I realized I had no clue how to create a post. I know\u0026hellip;I know this is terrible, however its still much better than wordpress. I stumbled across an awesome tool that would help you manage your hugo/jekyll website Forestry.io\nIt is quite simple, you login with your Github, Bitbucket, etc account and it can detect your existing repositories. From here, click on Add Site.\nFrom here you will select whether it is a huge or jekyll project, and select which version you wish to have the site built with (later is better!)\nFrom here you will choose where to import your project from, in my case i choose github. You will be prompted to login, and then choose a public or private repo.\nYou will now select which repository and branch you wish to choose. Choose a name, and URL (optional)\nThen you will select how you wish Forestry to publish your site, you can choose from none, back to the source repo, github pages, ftp, and many many more. save your changes and your site will be processed and you are almost ready to go!\nWe can see it imported my 3 pages, 112 posts, my site parameters, menus, media and front matter. One thing to note, it uses its own front matter templates for your posts, but will import yours in, but if you make any changes be careful as it only appends and doesn\u0026rsquo;t overwrite.\nDig into the settings and theres lots you can do. Its free for one user and seems logically priced to add more features/users. However i think this will be good to get my started on my blog post.\nIf you are curious on testing it out, clone your repo, use that, commit the source to the local repo and use the built in preview to check it out.\nThis post was entirely written using the CMS service in the WYSIWYG editor.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t have to update any markdown manually. (I checked to make sure the formatting is correct!)\n","permalink":"https://davidstamen.com/2018/01/02/using-forestry.io-to-manage-your-hugo-blog/","tags":["Hugo","Forestry.io"],"title":"Using Forestry.io to Manage Your Hugo Blog"},{"categories":["Certification"],"contents":"So today I successfully passed the VMware Certified Advanced Professional 6.5 – Data Center Virtualization Design Exam 3V0-624!\nI had set a personal goal at the beginning of the year, that I would pass the VCAP6-DCV Design and unfortunately after months of studying I took it and failed in March. I was ready to give up based on the cost of the exam and the time i spent studying. However, I found out recently that a new version based on 6.5 was released in August and the Visio like design sections were dropped (which were the biggest pain), so I worked to acquire a voucher from work and decided on 3 days ago since I had some downtime at work I would go for it.\nThe first thing i did was pull up the 6.5 exam guide. I was surprised it was not detailed at all in the blueprint breakdown, id did have a lot more information on what to expect question wise. So my first recommendation is if you plan to take the 6.5 exam, use the 6.0 blueprint. I also made a post VMware Certified Advanced Professional 6 – Data Center Virtualization Design Guide (3V0 622) that broke it down as well with links to all the documentation.\nEven with that I still felt a little lost on what to expect, there have not been a lot of blog posts about the experience with the 6.5 exam. All I knew is that it was 60 questions, that were multiple choice, matching, drag and drop and I had 135 minutes to complete it. After some digging I was able to find out Hersey Cartwright was the only person I was able to find who posted briefly about what to expect, and I think it definitely helped me a lot. Here were some of his tips, and a few of mine..\nCouple of tips for the exam:  Read the Exam Prep Guide!!! Everything you need to be successful is there (except experience).  Definately read through this to understand some of the types of questions that will be asked!   When taking the exam MAKE SURE YOU READ THE QUESTION or DESIGN SCENARIO completely, then read it again before selecting your answers or completing the question activity.  Some questions can be answered multiple ways, make sure to read it over and over and completely understand it, dont read the first line and jump to the end   You are able to flag questions for review – but use this wisely. If you are prepared trust your gut don’t second guess yourself.  As always be cautious! Your first instinct may be right   Take your time. Since there are no Visio style questions you are given plenty of time (IMHO) to complete the exam. Relax, read the question, answer, move on.  I completed the first pass in about an hour, the drag and drop and matching questions took a bit of time, but some of the multiple choice answers were very easy to answer and move ahead. It left me plenty of time to review and check things   Technical tip: Have a deep understand of dependencies required for, and limitations of, vSphere features and services and how these dependencies may impact the ability to meet a design requirement or may introduce risks into a design.  This 100%, you need to understand all the components of a vSphere deployment including interoperability, upgrades and features. Please make note on what features would be available in 6.0 and 6.5 and upgrades!   AMPRS  I could not say this any more, make sure to know about your Availability, Management, Performance, Recoverability and Security sections!   RCAR  You NEED to know Risks, Constraints, Assumptions and Requirements. Just like AMPRS, if you don\u0026rsquo;t have a solid understanding of this you will definitely fail this exam.   Functional vs Non-Functional Requirements  Make sure to understand this as well, it is key    Interface Feedback This was one thing I think they did much better, however there were some caveats.\n With some of the drag and drops, it was hard to review you work as when you brought over the statement, you could no like see what it was assigned to without removing it. On an example with diagrams, it would not let me move forward until I enlarged them all, once I did that it still refused. After a few minutes i realized one of the examples had scroll bars up and down and left and right, and even through the complete diagram was in view, I had to use the scroll bars to proceed. I was glad it did this, to prevent you from moving on and missing something, but the fact that multiple images were the same size and only 1 had scroll bars could be related to a UI issue.  Study Materials As far as study materials? I used quite a few. I will list them below and will add and update this blog as i remember a few more.\nvBrownbag VCAP Series\n Not only did I look over the 6.0 series, I went back and reviewed some of the 5.5 ones as well as a lot of the information carried over.  vSAN 6.2 Essentials book\n If i needed to know about vSAN, what is a better place to learn?  VMware vSphere 6.x Datacenter Design Cookbook\n This was Hersey Cartwright\u0026rsquo;s book, that had tons of information, and was probably my primary point of studying the last 3 days.  VCAP5-DCD Official Cert Guide (VMware Press)\n Yes. This is many versions ago, however the core principals still apply and the information within is still valid minus changes in vSphere versions.  Community\n Tons of users in the community have created countless study guides and exam feedback, my last half day of studying was just reviewing these things and trying to reinforce what I already know.  Whats Next Now? I met my yearly goal, and am now a VCIX! I am very proud of this achievement and appreciate everyone who helped me along the way. People asked me about my VCDX, and I think that will wait a bit\u0026hellip;but you never know what will happen in the future.\n","permalink":"https://davidstamen.com/2017/12/21/vcap6.5-dcv-design-experience/","tags":["VCAP6.5-DCV Design"],"title":"VCAP6.5-DCV Design Experience"},{"categories":["Office"],"contents":"I have been looking for a new desk for awhile. Working from home I do not get to go into an office, or walk around to meet up with coworkers. I found myself sitting for way too long which hasn\u0026rsquo;t been best for the low back and leg pains I experience.\nI heard from a friend that getting a standing desk may be something that would be good. Standing desks come in all shapes and sizes but I knew from the start that I wanted a dedicated standing desk and just not a riser (one that sits on an existing desk).\nUpon doing research there were quite a few companies I began to research. StandDesk.co Autonomous and Fully were the ones I based my feedback on as they met my requirements of a few things, mainly price.\nThere are quite a few resources to start your search. Here are some i used.\n Work While Walking BTOD Reddit-StandingDesk and Reddit-StandingDesks  and of course the company websites themselves.\nIn the end i ended up choosing StandDesk.co\u0026rsquo;s StandDesk Simple with the Brown Bamboo top. They do give you the option of just buying a stand and using your own top separately. However I was not up to the job this time around to find one, there is a lot of recommendations to use ones from Ikea, but I wanted to get a whole package that would be protected and warrantied through one company.\nOne great thing so about StandDesk is some of the other companies offer a 1 year warranty on a desk in this range. StandDesk offers a 30 day full price guarantee, and a 5 year warranty.\nAnother positive about this desk was the installation. Doing my research I read about nightmares installing some standing desks. It was compared to Ikea instructions with many pieces and being very difficult. I was surprised to have a very nice instruction book included that was extremely clear. The install probably took me somewhere between 30-60 minutes as I had children running all over the place during the install.\nIn the end I am very pleased with the desk and quality. The support team reached out as soon as I placed my order and tracked my shipment, the day it was delivered they sent me a personal message making sure it arrived properly and if I had any questions about the installation to contact them at any moment.\nIf you are in the market for a desk, I would definately check them out!\nIf you use the following referral link, you can also save $30.\n","permalink":"https://davidstamen.com/2017/08/24/my-new-desk-by-standdesk/","tags":["StandDesk"],"title":"My New Desk by StandDesk"},{"categories":["VMware"],"contents":"So it seems to be that time of year again with new projects coming around. This time its all about vRA. This is probably my first of many blogs to come about things I have come across.\nMy question today was how do I pre-create a computer AD account, join a device to the domain and then clean it up when the machine is destroyed.\nTurns out this is super simple in vRealize Automation 7.3!\nTIP: If you want to practice or follow along you can use HOL-1733-SDC-1 (vRealize Automation 7.2: What\u0026rsquo;s New)\nvRealize Automation 7.1 introduced the ability to place new machines in specific Organizational Units based on Business Group membership or a specific blueprint. To accomplish this, the following steps must be completed in vRealize Automation.\n Create an Active Directory Endpoint Create an Active Directory Policy Assign the Policy to a Blueprint or Business Group.  Create an Active Directory Endpoint  Log in to vRA as a tenant administrator. Navigate to the Administration Tab and select vRO Configuration. From here we will choose Endpoints and create a new Active Directory endpoint. Name the endpoint. (I suggest the domain name) Enter in the ldap server hostname or IP. Set the port 389 or 636(SSL) Set the Base DN for your lookups. Select if using SSL or not. Enter in the default domain name Enter in a user that will have rights to create, delete and move computer objects. Enter the Password.  Now your Active Directory Endpoint should be created and we can proceed to the next step.\nCreate an Active Directory Policy  Log in to vRA as a tenant administrator. Navigate to the Administration Tab and select Active Directory Policies. Click new and Set an ID (This cannot be changed, I set mine to be domainNameouName) Select the previous Active Directory Endpoint you created. Enter in your domain name Enter in the OU you wish the accounts to be created in.  Now your Active Directory Policy should be created and we can proceed to the next step.\nAssign the Policy to a Business Group.  Log in to vRA as a tenant administrator. Navigate to the Administration Tab, select Users \u0026amp; Groups and then Business Groups. Edit an existing or create a new business group. Update the Active Directory Policy to be the policy you created above.  Now your Active Directory Policy is assigned to the Business Group and we can proceed to the next step. Testing!\nMake sure you have a customization specification set on your blueprint that will join to the domain and kick it off, you should see the account get created and the machine deployed.\nOnce you destroy the machine, the account will be deleted and voila lifecycle is complete.\nHope this helps anyone, and if you have questions feel free to reach out on social media.\n","permalink":"https://davidstamen.com/2017/08/vra-73-using-active-directory-policies/","tags":["vRA"],"title":"vRA 7.3 - Using Active Directory Policies"},{"categories":["VMware"],"contents":"vSphere 6.5U1 was released on July 27th. This is an incremental update a lot of people wait for before upgrading from a previous version. I have been lucky to have been running on vSphere 6.5 for quite some time and have been enjoying it very much.\nObviously we never upgrade production first, if we can help it. I decided to attempt an upgrade on one of our QA vCenters that was deployed using the VCHA Advanced workflow. I followed my standard upgrade steps Updating a VCHA 6.5 vCenter however when I went to failover the Active node to the upgraded passive/witness nodes, services would not start, I then noticed that the hostnames had reset to localhost.localdom which is kind of a big issue as vCenter relies on the hostname being set.\nI was able to workaround this issue temporarily by setting the hostname correctly in /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts to be able to recover from the failure and break VCHA. Luckily i had a snapshot to rollback to as well.\nNow we had this one upgraded, I still could not re-enable VCHA. I went through the process to configure VCHA, however every time I would deploy the passive/witness it would still reset the hostname, and when I went to finalize the configuration it would fail because the passive/witness hostnames did not match the active node. It seemed the issue was not with the servers themselves but possibly with some updated scripts that sync certain configuration files.\nI was able to find someone else who could reproduce this issue and we both opened a case with is being investigated by engineering.\nUpdate. Finally heard back from support. So it seems in some cases the VAMI configuration can be \u0026ldquo;corrupt\u0026rdquo; and can cause the hostname to reset.\nAfter upgrading your appliance, if you see the hostname reset, you can run the following command to reconfigure it properly.\n1/opt/vmware/share/vami/vami_config_net Once I used the configuration script to reconfigure the hostname I was successfully able to redeploy VCHA.\n","permalink":"https://davidstamen.com/2017/08/02/vcenter-6.5u1-update-issues-with-vcha-advanced-deployment/","tags":["vCenter Server","vSphere 6.5","vCenter HA"],"title":"vCenter 6.5U1 Update Issues with VCHA Advanced Deployment"},{"categories":["Blog"],"contents":"Another New Blog Platform!

The answer may not be as easy as it seems.\nI have been working on a Migration from PowerDNS using a MySQL DB. We have a custom solution which gets updated and gets pushed to Akamai. The problem is, this custom solution requires all the zones to be in bind format. Doing some research I found out there is no easy way to get these zones into a bind zone file. You could setup a secondary server and do zone transfers, but that wouldnt meet my requirements.\nLuckily I stumbled across this post by James Linden in which he created a PHP script that scrapes the entire database and then generates a bind file for each zone with the records.\nIt is actually a pretty easy script to run, you need to fill in about 5 variables and then you are good to execute it. Here is a copy of the script in case it is no longer available. (It was created in 2013, but still works flawlessly!)\nAll you need to do is update the 3 lines, to put in the MySQL DB IP, the username, password and database name. You will then enter in the nameservers and hostmaster to be used for the bind files.\n1#!/bin/env php 2\u0026lt;?php 3 4/** 5 * @copyright 2013 James Linden \u0026lt;kodekrash@gmail.com\u0026gt; 6 * @author James Linden \u0026lt;kodekrash@gmail.com\u0026gt; 7 * @url http://jameslinden.com/code/powerdns-to-bind-zone 8 * @license BSD (2 clause) \u0026lt;http://www.opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause\u0026gt; 9 */ 10 11$pdns_db = [ \u0026#39;host\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;localhost\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;user\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;root\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;pass\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;powerdns\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;powerdns\u0026#39; ]; 12$zone_ns = [ \u0026#39;ns1.lab.local\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;ns2.lab.local\u0026#39; ]; 13$zone_adm = \u0026#39;support.lab.local\u0026#39;; 14 15$zones = []; 16$db = new mysqli( $pdns_db[\u0026#39;host\u0026#39;], $pdns_db[\u0026#39;user\u0026#39;], $pdns_db[\u0026#39;pass\u0026#39;], $pdns_db[\u0026#39;name\u0026#39;] ); 17if( $q = $db-\u0026gt;query( \u0026#39;SELECT * FROM domains\u0026#39; ) ) { 18\twhile( $r = $q-\u0026gt;fetch_assoc() ) { 19\t$d = strtolower( $r[\u0026#39;name\u0026#39;] ); 20\tif( $q1 = $db-\u0026gt;query( \u0026#39;SELECT * FROM records WHERE domain_id=\u0026#39; . $r[\u0026#39;id\u0026#39;] ) ) { 21\t$x = [ \u0026#39;A\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; [], \u0026#39;CNAME\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; [], \u0026#39;NS\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; [], \u0026#39;MX\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; [], \u0026#39;TXT\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; [] ]; 22\twhile( $r1 = $q1-\u0026gt;fetch_assoc() ) { 23\t$r1[\u0026#39;name\u0026#39;] = strtolower( $r1[\u0026#39;name\u0026#39;] ); 24\tswitch( $r1[\u0026#39;type\u0026#39;] ) { 25\tcase \u0026#39;A\u0026#39;: 26\t$x[ $r1[\u0026#39;type\u0026#39;] ][] = [ $r1[\u0026#39;name\u0026#39;], $r1[\u0026#39;content\u0026#39;] ]; 27\tbreak; 28\tcase \u0026#39;CNAME\u0026#39;: 29\t$x[ $r1[\u0026#39;type\u0026#39;] ][] = [ trim( str_replace( $d, null, $r1[\u0026#39;name\u0026#39;] ), \u0026#39;.\u0026#39; ), strtolower( $r1[\u0026#39;content\u0026#39;] ) ]; 30\tbreak; 31\tcase \u0026#39;NS\u0026#39;: 32\t$x[ $r1[\u0026#39;type\u0026#39;] ][] = strtolower( $r1[\u0026#39;content\u0026#39;] ); 33\tbreak; 34\tcase \u0026#39;MX\u0026#39;: 35\t$x[ $r1[\u0026#39;type\u0026#39;] ][] = [ (int)$r1[\u0026#39;prio\u0026#39;], strtolower( $r1[\u0026#39;content\u0026#39;] ) ]; 36\tbreak; 37\tcase \u0026#39;TXT\u0026#39;: 38\t$x[ $r1[\u0026#39;type\u0026#39;] ][] = [ trim( str_replace( $d, null, $r1[\u0026#39;name\u0026#39;] ), \u0026#39;.\u0026#39; ), $r1[\u0026#39;content\u0026#39;] ]; 39\tbreak; 40\t} 41\t} 42\t$q1-\u0026gt;free(); 43\t} 44\t$zones[ $d ] = $x; 45\t} 46\t$q-\u0026gt;free(); 47} 48$db-\u0026gt;close(); 49 50if( is_array( $zones ) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; count( $zones ) \u0026gt; 0 ) { 51\t$p = \u0026#39;./tmp/\u0026#39;; 52\tif( !is_dir( $p ) ) { 53\tif( !mkdir( $p ) ) { 54\tdie( \u0026#39;Unable to make tmp directory\u0026#39; .

My preference is Ubuntu.\n1echo \u0026#34;deb http://www.ubnt.com/downloads/unifi/debian unifi5 ubiquiti\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \\ 2 /etc/apt/sources.list.d/20ubiquiti.list \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ 3 echo \u0026#34;deb http://downloads-distro.mongodb.org/repo/debian-sysvinit dist 10gen\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \\ 4 /etc/apt/sources.list.d/21mongodb.list \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ 5 apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv C0A52C50 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ 6 apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv 7F0CEB10 7 8apt-get -q update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ 9 apt-get install -qy --force-yes --no-install-recommends unifi \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ 10 apt-get -q clean \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ 11 rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* 12 13service unifi start Once that completes you can access the controller at https://iporfqdn:8443\nA second option is to use a docker container. I built an image through some testing that is hosted on dockerhub dstamen/unifi. It works and there are plenty of images out there. It is based on the following dockerfile.\nA few other containers to review that are highly recommended are linuxserver/unifi and jacobalberty/unifi\nI hope this helps you on our way to getting your controller online.\n","permalink":"https://davidstamen.com/2016/12/02/installing-ubiquiti-unifi-controller/","tags":["Networking","Unifi"],"title":"Installing Ubiquiti Unifi Controller"},{"categories":["VMware"],"contents":"So as everyone has probably seen, vSphere 6.5 is now GA. One of the features i have been waiting for the most is vCenter HA. I have spent some time trying to get this working in my lab. Unfortunately after countless tries i was stuck. Thanks to folks in the vExpert Slack for helping me try to resolve this, but unfortunately this was a case for VMware Support.\nEvery time I would try to configure vCenter HA using the Advanced Wizard, I would get the following error.\n1The operation is not allowed in the current state. 2Failed to get management network information. Verify if management interface (NIC0) is configured correctly and is reachable. Obviously, if I am accessing the vCenter the management IP has to be configured and reachable correct?\nTurns out we tried to look through the logs in /var/log/vmware/vcha and they were no help. Next the technician tried to manually prepare for VCHA by running prepare-vcha. Once we ran this we were able to see a specific error outputted.\n1Unable to get hostname resolved IP address for eth0 This is more helpful! Turns out my vCenter somehow was missing it\u0026rsquo;s reverse DNS entry. This is definitely bizarre as the VCSA requires a reverse DNS to deploy.\nOnce I created the reverse DNS, the wizard finally let me through and configure vCenter HA!\nBig thank you to the vExpert community and VMware Support.\nLook forward to a formal KB and a more descriptive error in the future.\n","permalink":"https://davidstamen.com/2016/11/21/vsphere-65-vcha-issues/","tags":["vCenter HA","Availability"],"title":"vSphere 6.5 - vCenter HA (VCHA) Issues"},{"categories":["VMware"],"contents":"So as everyone has probably seen, vSphere 6.5 is now GA.

This exam was announced with a two week availability in the US priced at $100.\nMy experience with the exam was actually pretty good. The new interface for the advanced exams is that of an HOL. You are dropped onto the desktop and have a window that slides in and out to pull up the manual and other consoles.\nI would definately read up on Josh Andrew\u0026rsquo;s post about what to expect.\nI would also recommend going over the interface guide as well as this has lots of detailed information about the console, and limitations about the control key, akt key and backspace key (I will expand on that more below). Also please make note of the sections about optimizing the console, this is also in the on screen manual, I tried to skip over it, but without following these steps alot of the screen will be cutoff, go ahead and do it. It will make it easier for you.\nThe new interface is now HTML5 based and is extremely quick, in my testing center i did not experience any of the lag I did when i took the VCAP5.\nHowever there are a few things to make note of when taking try new exam. The following keys are disabled\u0026hellip; Ctrl, alt and backspace. This made a few tasks difficult I knew about ctrl going into the exam, but not having backspace at my disposal made a few things harder. The delete key is still active so at least you can clear some of the text you typed incorrectly.\none thing to add, there may not be a copy padte in all places but if you need to \u0026ldquo;copy\u0026rdquo; something from the manual you can highlight it and then drag it to a field in the console and it will \u0026ldquo;paste\u0026rdquo; thr content there.\nAs far as content, I think it was very good. I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel strapped on time and it was one of the better beta exam experiences I have had. I definitely recommend taking it if you can.\nThe exam never strayed off the blueprint, so If you are looking for something to study I would definitely make sure you cover all topics on the blueprint, it will help you in the long run.\nSome of the resources I used to study were the following.\n VMware Official Blueprint  https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/plan.cfm?plan=88753\u0026amp;ui=www_cert   vJenner Blog  http://www.vjenner.com/vcap6-dcv-deployment-study-guide/   vPentathlon  http://vpentathlon.com/vcap-dcv-deploy-study-guide/   Google Community for VCAP6-DCV  https://plus.google.com/communities/108002000588564278612   Tom Greene (This was really great to focus on where to study, it covers differences between VCAP5 and VCAP6)  http://www.thomgreene.com/blog/2016/6/16/vcap6-dcv-deploy-blueprint-changes-from-vcap5-dca   VMware HOL\u0026rsquo;s  HOL-SDC-1627 - VVol, Virtual SAN \u0026amp; Storage Policy-Based Management.

Every time I would run through a compliance check, they would always report they were up to date even when they were running an older version.\nI have recently made a breakthrough working with VMware Support and stumbling through some old blogs. Cisco Support has been terrible on this issue and after repeated attempts to get this case escalated i think the 10th time is a charm.\nFrom what I have found the issue lies in the metadata of the offline bundle. As you can see in the below screenshot. The ENIC driver is showing 6.x but the FNIC driver is showing 5.x. In this case the ENIC driver works and the FNIC driver does not.\nNote: The ENIC driver for 2.3.0.7 was recently updated to fix this, but every other driver is currently broken.\nTo update the metadata of the offline bundle and get VUM to work you need to perform the following steps.\n  Make sure you have 7zip and setup an editor within 7zip. I used notepad++.\n  Open the offline_bundle zip file\n  Edit the vendor-index.xml file and replace the 5 with 6\n  Open up the metadata.zip file\n  Edit the vendor-index.xml file and replace the 5 with 6\n  Edit the vmware.xml file and replace the 5 with 6\n  If you perform these steps, you can now import your customized offline bundle and it will accurately report 6.x in VUM and allow you to remediate your hosts.

I am not even sure if this is an array or VMware issue as this seems to affect 3Par and XtremIO as well.\nHowever, since I had to replicate this change to a bunch of hosts I created a script to make this change.\nLink to Script  Set-MaxDiskIO.ps1  Preparing to Execute the Script The script is pretty straight forward, just need to define a few variables seen below and then you execute the script.

For example, a datastore inherits permissions from either its parent datastore folder or parent data center. Virtual machines inherit permissions from both the parent virtual machine folder and the parent host, cluster, or resource pool simultaneously.   An example of an explicit permission:  User1 is assigned Permission to only see and modify VM1      View/Sort/Export user and group lists\n You can view, sort, and export lists of a host’s local users to a file that is in HTML, XML, Microsoft Excel, or CSV format.    Add/Modify/Remove permissions for users and groups on vCenter Server inventory objects\n Add a Permission to an Inventory Object  Browse to the object for which you want to assign permissions in the vSphere Web Client object navigator. Click the Manage tab and select Permissions. Click the Add icon, and click Add. Identify the user or group that will have the privileges defined by the selected role.  From the Domain drop-down menu, select the domain where the user or group is located. Type a name in the Search box or select a name from the list. Select the user or group and click Add. Click OK.   Select a role from the Assigned Role drop-down menu. (Optional) To limit propagation, deselect the Propagate to Child Objects check box. Click OK to add the permission.   Change Permissions  Browse to the object in the vSphere Web Client object navigator. Click the Manage tab and select Permissions. Click the line item to select the user or group and role pair. Click Change role on permission. Select a role for the user or group from the Assigned Role drop-down menu. To propagate the privileges to the children of the assigned inventory object, click the Propagate check box and click OK.   Remove Permissions  Browse to the object in the vSphere Web Client object navigator. Click the Manage tab and select Permissions. Click the appropriate line item to select the user or group and role pair. Click Remove permission.      Determine how permissions are applied and inherited in vCenter Server\n Global permissions are applied to a global root object that spans solutions, for example, both vCenter Server and vCenter Orchestrator. Use global permissions to give a user or group privileges for all objects in all object hierarchies.    Create/Clone/Edit vCenter Server Roles\n Create a Custom Role  Log in to vCenter Server with the vSphere Web Client. Select Home, click Administration, and click Roles. Click the Create role action (+) button. Type a name for the new role. Select privileges for the role and click OK.   Clone a Role  Log in to vCenter Server with the vSphere Web Client. Select Home, click Administration, and click Roles. Select a role, and click the Clone role action icon. Type a name for the cloned role. Select or deselect privileges for the role and click OK.   Edit a Role  Log in to vCenter Server with the vSphere Web Client. Select Home, click Administration, and click Roles. Select a role and click the Edit role action button. Select or deselect privileges for the role and click OK.      Configure VMware Directory Service\n Select a host in the vSphere Client inventory, and click the Configuration tab. Under Software, click Authentication Services. Click Properties. In the User Directory Services dialog box, select the directory service from the drop-down menu. Enter a domain. Click Join Domain. Enter the user name and password of a directory service user who has permissions to join the host to the domain, and click OK. Click OK to close the Directory Services Configuration dialog box.    Apply a role to a User/Group and to an object or group of objects\n Identify the user or group that will have the privileges defined by the selected role.  From the Domain drop-down menu, select the domain where the user or group is located. Type a name in the Search box or select a name from the list. Select the user or group and click Add. Click OK.   Select a role from the Assigned Role drop-down menu. Leave the Propagate to children check box selected in most cases. Click OK.    Change permission validation settings\n  vCenter Server periodically validates its user and group lists against the users and groups in the user directory. It then removes users or groups that no longer exist in the domain. You can disable validation or change the interval between validations. If you have domains with thousands of users or groups, or if searches take a long time to complete, consider adjusting the search settings.\n Browse to the vCenter Server system in the vSphere Web Client object navigator. Select the Manage tab and click Settings. Click General and click Edit. Select User directory. Change the values as needed. Click OK.      Determine the appropriate set of privileges for common tasks in vCenter Server\n Many tasks require permissions on more than one object in the inventory. You can review the privileges that are required to perform the tasks and, where applicable, the appropriate sample roles.    Compare and contrast default system/sample roles\n  System roles\n Cannot be modified or deleted.    Sample roles\n Apply to different user communities or restrict access for add-on tools. Several predefined user roles are included with vCenter Server and with ESXi systems. You can create new roles using these predefined user roles as a starting point.      Determine the correct permissions needed to integrate vCenter Server with other VMware products\n Global permissions are applied to a global root object that spans solutions, for example, both vCenter Server and vCenter Orchestrator. Use global permissions to give a user or group privileges for all objects in all object hierarchies. Each solution has a root object in its own object hierarchy. The global root object acts as a parent object to each solution object. You can assign global permissions to users or groups, and decide on the role for each user or group. The role determines the set of privileges. You can assign a predefined role or create custom roles. It is important to distinguish between vCenter Server permissions and global permissions.    Objective 1.2: Secure ESXi, vCenter Server, and vSphere Virtual Machines  Harden virtual machine access  Control VMware Tools installation  VM.disable-VMtools-autoinstall  Parameter: isolation.tools.autoInstall.disable Value: TRUE     Control VM data access Configure virtual machine security policies  The guest operating system that runs in the virtual machine is subject to the same security risks as a physical system. Secure virtual machines as you would secure physical machines.     Harden a virtual machine against Denial-of-Service attacks  Control VM-VM communications Control VM device connections Configure network security policies  Networking security policies determine how the adapter filters inbound and outbound frames. 3 types are as follows  Promiscuous Mode  Reject — Placing a guest adapter in promiscuous mode has no effect on which frames are received by the adapter. Accept — Placing a guest adapter in promiscuous mode causes it to detect all frames passed on the vSphere standard switch that are allowed under the VLAN policy for the port group that the adapter is connected to.   Mac Address Changes  Reject — If you set the MAC Address Changes to Reject and the guest operating system changes the MAC address of the adapter to anything other than what is in the .vmx configuration file, all inbound frames are dropped. Accept — Changing the MAC address from the Guest OS has the intended effect: frames to the new MAC address are received.     Forged Transmits  Reject — Any outbound frame with a source MAC address that is different from the one currently set on the adapter are dropped. Accept — No filtering is performed and all outbound frames are passed.       Harden ESXi Hosts  Enable/Configure/Disable services in the ESXi firewall  You can configure firewall properties to allow or deny access for a service or management agent. This can currently be set via the vSphere Web Client, vSphere client or command line.  Select a host from the inventory view and select configuration and then Security Profile.     Change default account access Add an ESXi Host to a directory service  You can configure a host to use a directory service such as Active Directory to manage users and groups. When you add an ESXi host to Active Directory all user and group accounts are assigned full administrative access to the host if the group ESX Admins exists.   Apply permissions to ESXi Hosts using Host Profiles  When you join a host to an Active Directory domain, you must define roles on the host for a user or group in that domain. Otherwise, the host is not accessible to Active Directory users or groups. You can use host profiles to set a required role for a user or group and to apply the change to one or more hosts. In the vSphere client select Management and then Host Profiles you can either use an existing or new host profile. Expand the profile tree and select Security Configuration, Permission Rules, Add Profile, Permission and then within configuration details use require a permission rule and add the appropriate settings. You can then select propagate permission and select ok.   Enable Lockdown Mode  Select a host from the inventory view and select configuration and then Security Profile. Click edit next to lockdown mode and select Enable.   Control access to hosts (DCUI/Shell/SSH/MOB)  By default, the ESXi Shell and SSH services are not running and only the root user can log in to the Direct Console User Interface (DCUI). If you decide to enable ESXi or SSH access, you can set timeouts to limit the risk of unauthorized access.     Harden vCenter Server  Control datastore browser access  You can use the Datastore.Low level file operations priveledge to restrict access to the database browser.  Allows performing read, write, delete, and rename operations in the datastore browser.     Create/Manage vCenter Server Security Certificates  The vSphere Certificate Manager utility allows you to perform most certificate management tasks interactively from the command line. vSphere Certificate Manager prompts you for the task to perform, for certificate locations and other information as needed, and then stops and starts services and replaces certificates for you.   Control MOB access  Use the Managed Object Browser only for debugging, and ensure that it is disabled in production systems.  Select the host in the vSphere Web Client and go to Advanced System Settings. Check the value of Config.HostAgent.plugins.solo.enableMob and change it as appropriate.     Change default account access  Because many appliances do not include default user accounts, the root account may still be able to directly login via SSH. To meet the compliance standards for non- repudiation, the SSH server on all hardened appliances comes preconfigured with the AllowGroups wheel entry to restrict ssh access to the secondary group wheel.   Restrict administrative privileges  Many tasks can be performed by the root user by default. Instead of allowing administrators to log in to the ESXi host using the root user account, you can apply different host configuration privileges to different named users from the vCenter Server permissions management interface. You can create a custom roles, assign privileges to the role, and associate the role with a named user and an ESXi host object from the vSphere Web Client.     Understand the implications of securing a vSphere environment  Security hardening for a typical Linux system potentially requires dozens of steps, such as changing file permissions, disabling services, and managing user privileges; ESXi requires none of these steps, most of which either are impossible to perform or have no effect. The primary measures required for hardening an ESXi host involve securing and properly managing the interfaces with the system that are used for configuration, management, and troubleshooting.    Objective 1.3: Enable SSO and Active Directory Integration   Describe SSO architecture and components\n vCenter Single Sign-On allows vSphere components to communicate with each other through a secure token mechanism instead of requiring users to authenticate separately with each component. Below are some examples of the SSO architecture for human and solution users    Differentiate available authentication methods with VMware vCenter\n vCenter Single Sign-On uses a combination of STS (Security Token Service), SSL for secure traffic, and authentication of human users through Active Directory or OpenLDAP and of solution users through certificates.    Perform a multi-site SSO installation\n In this configuration each site is independent with PSC replication between sites. The vCenter Server is aware of the site topologies and use the local PSC under normal circumstances. Customers are able to seamlessly move the vCenter Servers between PSCs when necessary. This topology allows for Enhanced Linked Mode (ELM) which is facilitated by the PSC. Enhanced Linked Mode provides for a single point of management for all vCenter Servers in the same vSphere domain. In vSphere 6 the Windows-based and Virtual Appliance-based vCenter Servers have the same operational maximums and can belong to the same linked mode configuration. The configuration replicates all license, global permissions, tags and roles across all sites    Configure/Manage Active Directory Authentication\n Active Directory authentication is configured from the Single Sign-On administration page, here you will add an additional identify source for Active Directory. If using Microsoft Active Directory, select Active Directory (Integrated Windows Authentication). It will auto-populate the root domain in the forest. If using Open LDAP, select and configure it.    Configure/Manage Platform Services Controller (PSC)\n The PSC includes common services used across VMware vCloud® Suite. This includes VMware vCenter Single Sign-On™, licensing, and certificate management. This is managed and configured by using the vSphere Web Client and selecting Administration and then System configuration and choosing the appropriate node.    Configure/Manage VMware Certificate Authority (VMCA)\n VMCA is included in each Platform Services Controller and in each embedded deployment. VMCA provisions each node, each vCenter Server solution user, and each ESXi host with a certificate that is signed by VMCA as the certificate authority. vCenter Server solution users are groups of vCenter Server services. See vSphere Security for a list of solution users. You can replace the default certificates. For vCenter Server components, you can use a set of command-line tools included in your installation. You have several options. You can either use the VMCA as a certificate authority or configure it to be an intermediate CA.    Enable/Disable Single Sign-On (SSO) Users\n You configure vCenter Single Sign-On from the vSphere Web Client. To configure vCenter Single Sign-On, you must have vCenter Single Sign-On administrator privileges. Having vCenter Single Sign-On administrator privileges is different from having the Administrator role on vCenter Server or ESXi. By default, only the user administrator-vsphere.local has administrator privileges on the vCenter Single SignOn server in a new installation Identify available authentication methods with VMware vCenter    Upgrade a single/multi-site SSO installation\n  Configure SSO policies\n Password Policy: You can configure the following parameters:  Description – Password policy description. Required. Maximum lifetime – Maximum number of days that a password can exist before it has to be changed. Restrict re-use – Number of the user’s previous passwords that cannot be set again. Maximum length – Maximum number of characters that are allowed in the password. Minimum length – Minimum number of characters required in the password. Character requirements – Minimum number of different character types required in the password. Identical adjacent characters – Maximum number of identical adjacent characters allowed in the password.   Lockout Policy: Specifies the condition under which a vCenter SSO account is locked when the user attempts to log in with incorrect credentials. Five login attempts and three minutes between failures are set by default. This policy also specifies the time that must elapse before the account is automatically unlocked.  Description – Description of the lockout policy. Required. Max. number of failed login attempts – Maximum number of failed login attempts that are allowed before the account is locked. Time interval between failures (seconds) – Time period in which failed login attempts must occur to trigger a lockout. Unlock time (seconds) – Amount of time that the account remains locked. If you enter 0, the account must be explicitly unlocked by an administrator.   Token Policy  Maximum token renewal count Maximum token delegation count Maximum bearer token lifetime Maximum holder-of-key token lifetime      Add/Edit/Remove SSO identity sources\n Open your Web browser and navigate to https://vcenter:9443, where vcenter is the FQDN of the vCenter Server. Log in with User name administrator@vsphere.local and the Password used during installation. Click Administration in the left-hand Navigator pane Click Configuration under vCenter Single Sign-On Click Identity Sources Click the green plus icon to Add Identity Source. If using Microsoft Active Directory, select Active Directory (Integrated Windows Authentication). It will autopopulate the root domain in the forest. If using Open LDAP, select and configure it. Highlight the newly added identity source. Click the Set as Default Domain icon. Click Yes in the pop-up.    Add an ESXi Host to an AD domain\n Select a host in the vSphere Client inventory, and click the Configuration tab. Under Software, click Authentication Services. Click Properties.

To connect all network adapters of a virtual machine to a distributed port group, select the virtual machine, or select an individual network adapter to connect only that adapter. Click Assign port group. Select a distributed port group from the list and click OK.   Click Next and click Finish.    Configure LACP on vDS given design parameters\n You configure a LAG with two or more ports and connect physical NICs to the ports. LAG ports are teamed within the LAG, and the network traffic is load balanced between the ports through an LACP hashing algorithm. You can use a LAG to handle the traffic of distributed port groups to provide increased network bandwidth, redundancy, and load balancing to the port groups. When you create a LAG on a distributed switch, a LAG object is also created on the proxy switch of every host that is connected to the distributed switch. For example, if you create LAG1 with two ports, LAG1 with the same number of ports is created on every host that is connected to the distributed switch. On a host proxy switch, you can connect one physical NIC to only one LAG port. On the distributed switch, one LAG port can have multiple physical NICs from different hosts connected to it. The physical NICs on a host that you connect to the LAG ports must be connected to links that participate in an LACP port channel on the physical switch. You can create up to 64 LAGs on a distributed switch. A host can support up to 32 LAGs. However, the number of LAGs that you can actually use depends on the capabilities of the underlying physical environment and the topology of the virtual network. For example, if the physical switch supports up to four ports in an LACP port channel, you can connect up to four physical NICs per host to a LAG.    Describe vDS Security Polices/Settings\n In the vSphere Web Client, navigate to the distributed switch. Navigate to the Security policy for the distributed port group or port.   Reject or accept promiscuous mode activation or MAC address changes in the guest operating system of the virtual machines attached to the distributed port group or port.   Review your settings and apply the configuration.    Configure dvPort group blocking policies\n In the vSphere Web Client, navigate to the distributed switch. Right-click the distributed switch in the object navigator and select Distributed Port Group \u0026gt; Manage Distributed Port Groups. Select the Miscellaneous check box and click Next. Select one or more distributed port group to configure and click Next. From the Block all ports drop-down menu, enable or disable port blocking, and click Next. Review your settings and click Finish.    Configure load balancing and failover policies\n In the vSphere Web Client, navigate to the distributed switch. Navigate the Teaming and Failover policy on the distributed port group or port.   From the Load Balancing drop-down menu, specify how the virtual switch load balances the outgoing traffic between the physical NICs in a team.   From the Network Failover Detection drop-down menu, select the method that the virtual switch uses for failover detection.   From the Notify Switches drop-down menu, select whether the standard or distributed switch notifies the physical switch in case of a failover. From the Failback drop-down menu, select whether a physical adapter is returned to active status after recovering from a failure.  If failback is set to Yes, the default selection, the adapter is returned to active duty immediately upon recovery, displacing the standby adapter that took over its slot, if any.  If failback is set to No for a distributed port, a failed adapter is left inactive after recovery only if the associated virtual machine is running. When the Failback option is No and a virtual machine is powered off, if all active physical adapters fail and then one of them recovers, the virtual NIC is connected to the recovered adapter instead of to a standby one after the virtual machine is powered on. Powering a virtual machine off and then on leads to reconnecting the virtual NIC to a distributed port. The distributed switch considers the port as newly added, and assigns it the default uplink port, that is, the active uplink adapter.     Specify how the uplinks in a team are used when a failover occurs by configuring the Failover Order list.  If you want to use some uplinks but reserve others for emergencies in case the uplinks in use fail, use the up and down arrow keys to move uplinks into different groups.     Review your settings and apply the configuration.    Configure VLAN/PVLAN settings for VM\u0026rsquo;s given communication requirements\n A private VLAN is identified by its primary VLAN ID. A primary VLAN ID can have multiple secondary VLAN IDs associated with it. Primary VLANs are Promiscuous, so that ports on a private VLAN can communicate with ports configured as the primary VLAN. Ports on a secondary VLAN can be either Isolated, communicating only with promiscuous ports, or Community, communicating with both promiscuous ports and other ports on the same secondary VLAN. In the vSphere Web Client, navigate to the distributed switch. On the Manage tab, click Settings. Select Private VLAN and click Edit. To add a primary VLAN, under Primary VLAN ID click Add and enter the ID of a primary VLAN. Click the plus sign (+) in front of the primary VLAN ID to add it to the list. To add a secondary VLAN, in the right pane click Add and enter the ID of the VLAN. Click the plus sign (+) in front of the secondary VLAN ID to add it to the list. From the drop-down menu in the Secondary VLAN type column, select either Isolated or Community. Click OK.    Configure traffic shaping policies\n In the vSphere Web Client, navigate to the distributed switch. Navigate to the Traffic Shaping policy for the distributed port group or port.   Configure traffic shaping policies.   Review your settings and apply the configuration.

With the release of 6.0U1 it still exists.\nHere is VMware\u0026rsquo;s exlanation of the cause.\n1ESXi migrates interrupts across physical CPUs in order to load balance the interrupt activity in the system. As part of the ESXi 26.0 changes to increase the number of interrupts supported, provisions were made to retire a vector on an old physical CPU when 3the interrupt migrates to a new one. In 6.0, interrupts tend to arrive at retired vectors, for unknown reasons at this time. There is however a workaround, but it can have an impact on CPU performance, and who want\u0026rsquo;s that?\nTo Install/Enable the script:\n11. Download the attached 2124669_stop_intr_mig.zip file. 22. Extract the file. 33. Copy the stop_intr_mig.py to the target ESXi host. 44. Enable the script when the system is running its most common \u0026#39;steady state\u0026#39; workload. (Not idling. Not spiking.) 55. Run this command chmod +x stop_intr_mig.py. 66.

So please use this at your own risk. Lets get started!\n Logon to your existing Ravello account. If you do not have one you can sign up for the free trial Create your Application   Once your application is created you will be dropped to the Canvas. Here we can use a pre-existing blueprint(template) as our base. I used Ubuntu Server 14.04.1 20150301. Click and drag it to your Canvas.   By Default, the blueprint is a 1CPU, 2GB RAM, 32GB HDD which should be plenty to run your blog. You can customize your virtual machine on the following fields. Make sure to hit save!  Summary: Overall Details of your VM General: Name your VM here, add a description and hostname. You will also create and choose your keypair to use to logon to the linux server System: Allocate your CPU and RAM here Disks: Modify disk size or allocate additional space Network: Set IP to be DHCP or Static within your application.  Pro Tip: Use an Elastic IP so your server always has the same external IP   Services: Set what ports you want available externally, by default 22 for ssh is there, you will want to add http(port80) for your website to become available.   You will now see your updated VM and tabs for the enabled services. Now you are ready to Publish it.   Here you will chose whether you want to publish your VM for cost or performance and if you want to use Amazon or Google clouds.  I have chosen to use Amazon Performance based out of Virginia. You can see the details and breakdown on cost.     Your VM will now be published and started.  Once it is started you will see the status and the information to access it.     You can ssh to yoserver-jekyll-eagwapmr.srv.ravcloud.com linux VM with the following syntax.  ssh ubuntu@server-jekyll-eagwapmr.srv.ravcloud.com -i keyfilename.pem   Now you are logged on you can install and configure NGINX to host your website.  Update the repository: sudo apt-get update Install NGINX: sudo apt-get install nginx   Access your blog http://server-jekyll-eagwapmr.srv.ravcloud.com/  If you setup your services appropriately you will now see the Welcome to nginx! site. What?! It is that easy? Yep!     We will go one step further to reconfigure to host our own blog.  Create directory to host your site: sudo mkdir /var/www/mydomain.com Make website folder available publically: sudo chmod 775 /var/www/mydomain.com Upload your website content here. For Jekyll upload the built _sites folder.   Now lets configure nginx to host your new website!  Copy default configuration file as a template: sudo cp /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /etc/nginx/sites-available/mydomain.com Use VIM to update file: VIM /etc/nginx/sites-available/mydomain.com We only need to edit a few lines here:  Change host directory from: root /usr/share/nginx/html; to root /var/www/mydomain.com Change server_name to be your websites URL: server_name localhost; to server_name www.mydomain.com mydomain.com;     Create link to publish site: sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/mydomain.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ Reload nginx config: sudo service nginx restart Your new site is now available!

I have never taken a VMware beta exam so I wasn\u0026rsquo;t quite sure what to expect, from what I have been told, I expected lots of questions with bad grammar and horrible spelling. However today I got something a bit different. Ill explain it best without violating any NDA.\nI sat down and as usual started the exam. After the initial \u0026ldquo;Welcome to the Exam\u0026rdquo; screen which stated i would have 75 questions in 95 minutes. I was expecting some survey questions or introduction to the beta, however I was wrong you are immediately dropped into the test. About 40 minutes later I finished and felt pretty good, the bad news is I have to wait 8-10 weeks after the beta exam concludes for my results and based on my calculation I feel the beta exam will be around for at least another 4 weeks. This means i will need to wait between 12-14 weeks for my results.\nExam Content I feel the content the exam covered was a good mixture. The last DCV exam was about 2 years prior so I felt the new exam covered a good bit of installation, administration, configuration and troubleshooting. This exam snuck up on me so I really didn\u0026rsquo;t get to complete as much studying as I wanted to, I only got up to Section 3.1. I feel if I would have gotten a chance to study the whole blueprint I would be feeling more comfortable with whatever my results may be. I will still continue to finish out my studying and guide just in case I dont get a satisfactory result. However based on the content I did study as always the blueprint lined up very well with the content on the exam.\nFeedback I really wish that there was notes for each question on the exam. There were some questions that would of benefited from user feedback, I know beta exams are there to really test the end user and I feel being able to provide feedback would of generally helped the beta process.\nWould I do it again? Maybe. Like I stated above but not being able to provide feedback, I feel like I was just an experiment with VMware to see how I could score the exam. If the beta exams returned to how they once were (Invite only and feedback allowed). I would definately be interested.\n","permalink":"https://davidstamen.com/2015/04/27/vcp6-dcv-delta-exam-beta-thoughts/","tags":["VCP6-DCV"],"title":"VCP6-DCV Delta Exam (Beta) Thoughts"},{"categories":["VMware"],"contents":"So one thing I have come across with a few VCSA6 installs was the inability to use login with current credentials via the Web client or vSphere client.\nWorking with VMware support we were finally able to get it working with a few tweaks and there is a current pending KB that has not been published yet. (KB2113038) I have been told this affects both an embedded deployment (VCSA and PSC together) and external deployment (VCSA and PSC seperate.)\nIf using an embedded VCSA+PSC make sure the VM is joined to the domain. If using an external VCSA and PSC you can easily join the PSC to the domain using the vSphere Web Client.  Log in to your vSphere Web Client. Navigate to Administration-\u0026gt;System Configuration-\u0026gt;Nodes Select your PSC and select the Active Directory Tab.   From here you can enter in your domain and credentials and join it to the domain, after it is successful you will need to restart the PSC.  If you try to select your VCSA and look for the Active Directory tab you will notice it is missing, to join your VCSA to the domain you need to perform the domain join via the CLI.  SSH to your VCSA Query the device to see if it is joined to the domain   /opt/likewise/bin/domainjoin-cli query   Join the device to the domain using the following syntax, you will need to enter int he domainname, user with rights to join domain   /opt/likewise/bin/domainjoin-cli join domainname adminusername   Once it is successful reboot the system and rerun the query to see if it was successfully joined   /opt/likewise/bin/domainjoin-cli query   At this point if you try to login with the current credentials you will still fail as there is one additional step. This will need to be completed on the VCSA virtual machine.   SSH to the appropriate appliance\n  Navigate to /etc/ and using your favorite text editor modify the nsswitch.conf file. (Examples are using VI)\n  Look for the line \u0026ldquo;password: compat ato\u0026rdquo; this line will need to be modified   Modify the line to read \u0026ldquo;passwd: compat ato lsass\u0026rdquo;   Once you have updated the file and saved it, restart the VCSA or its services\n   service vmware-vpxd restart  Now wait\u0026hellip;.in multiple tests it takes 30 minutes until you are able to logon using the credentials and it will now work for both the web and c# client.

I have been looking forwarding to using vCHS since it went GA and am glad to finally have the opportunity to use it hands on.\nOnce I got access I knew I wanted to copy some of my existing workloads to vCHS instead of having to start from scratch. I begin to look for some good guides on implementing vCloud Connector 2.6 but couldn\u0026rsquo;t find anything as it was just released and majorly overhauled.\nSo here is my first howto blog post, I hope it helps you get your POC configured nice and smooth.\nFirst you will need to download the vCloud Connector Server and vCloud Connector Node from https://my.vmware.com. vCloud Connector 2.6 is now free and no longer needs a license.\nOnce you have the two OVF bundles downloaded you will need to deploy them through vCenter.\n Select File, Deploy OVF.  Now browse and select the vCloud Connector Server OVF File  Next you will be prompted with the OVF Information and requirements, select Next.  Accept the EULA.  Leave Default VM Name  Choose the host/cluster you wish to deploy to.  Choose a resource pool (if utilized)  Choose your datastore.  Choose your Disk Format, in most cases you may want to use Thin.  Select your network port group.  Fill in Static IP information, if you want to use DHCP leave all fields blank.  Review your settings and then hit Finish to deploy your vCloud Connector Server.  Repeat all steps above for your vCloud Connector Node. This will be utilized to add your Private Cloud (vCenter) to vCloud Connector to move virtual machines to vCHS.\nDeploying vCloud Connector 2.6 and Configuring For vCHS (Part 2)\n","permalink":"https://davidstamen.com/2014/06/03/deploying-vcloud-connector-2-6-and-configuring-for-vchs-part-1/","tags":["vCloud Air"],"title":"Deploying vCloud Connector 2.6 and Configuring For vCHS (Part 1)"},{"categories":["VMware"],"contents":"Here is Part 2 a continuation of Deploying vCloud Connector 2.6 and Configuring For vCHS (Part 1) (http://davidstamen.com/2014/06/03/deploying-vcloud-connector-2-6-and-configuring-for-vchs-part-1/) where we will configure vCloud connector to your Private(vCenter) and Public(vCHS) clouds.\nLets start with getting the vCloud Connector Server ready. Just in case you forgot what IP you assigned we can open the appliance and view the management information.\nAs we can see here the URL to configure the appliace is https://192.168.0.13:5480 and the default username is admin and default password is vmware.\nOnce logged in it is best to update the timezone. Select your timezone and make sure to Save Settings.\nIt is also best to make sure you change the default passwords, so select the Server tab and enter in your new information.\nThe next thing we want to do is make sure we register the vCloud Connector Server with vCenter so we get the plugin to manage the solution. Select the vSphere Tab underneath server and enter in your vCenter information and make sure to select register.Now that we have vCloud Connector registered with vCenter and the vSphere client we can go away and add in our nodes.\nNavigate to the nodes tab and select Register Node.\nIn order to register vCHS as a node we first need to logon and gather some information. So navigate to https://vchs.vmware.com and select your VDC. On the right hand side expand vCloud Director API URL underneath Related Links. We will need to copy the first aprt of the URL. In our case https://p1v17-vcd.vchs.vmware.com\nHere we will need to enter in the vCHS tenant information. Our Display Name(This will be the cloud name within vCloud Connector) the Node URL(This is the link to your vCHS Instance, append 8443 as vCHS uses a different port), If it is a public cloud(vCHS), Cloud Type will be vCloud Director, vCD-Org Name will be your vCD name within vCHS and then username and password will be your vCHS Information.\nOnce you are done select register and you will see your vCHS instance successfully registered. You will also note it appended the full url to the organization.\nNow we need to go ahead and configure our vCloud Connector Node to be able to add our vCenter(Private Cloud). Navigate to the management IP port 5480 and use the default username admin and password vmware as we did with the server. Make sure to update the timezone and password appropriately as we did above.\nNow we will navigate to the node tab and select Cloud Registration. This is where we will enter in our vCenter server. Enter in your vCenter IP and make sure to select Ignore SSL Cert if you are using the default certificate or future steps will fail. Select Update configuration and we are all done configuring the node.\nWe will now go back to the vCloud Connector Server to register our additional node. Enter in the Display Name in which it will show up in the management console, the node URL, will be the IP of the vCloud Connector Node, Cloud Type will be vSphere and the credentials will be an account with administrator rights into vCenter.\nSelect Register and you should now see your private and public clouds registered.\nNow that the vCloud Connector Server is all ready we can now add the Clouds we registered as nodes. Lets navigate to our vSphere client and look at a new plugin that has been added.\nOnce selected we can now add objects to our cloud, select Clouds and select the green + sign to add our private and public clouds to manage.\nLets add our Public Cloud (vCHS) First. From the Drop down for name select the display name you set above. All we need to enter here is your vCHS username and password and select Add.\nNow we can add our vCenter (Private Cloud)\nSelect the + sign again and choose your vCenter node you registered previously. Enter in the same username and password you used to register the node.\nNow if we go back to our Clouds tab we can now see both our public and private clouds registered.\nYou can now migrate your private cloud workloads to the public cloud!\nDeploying vCloud Connector 2.6 and Configuring For vCHS (Part 3)\n","permalink":"https://davidstamen.com/2014/06/03/deploying-vcloud-connector-2-6-and-configuring-for-vchs-part-2/","tags":["vCloud Air"],"title":"Deploying vCloud Connector 2.6 and Configuring For vCHS (Part 2)"},{"categories":["VMware"],"contents":"For upcoming testing there was a need to create 140 datastores on a cluster for testing.
