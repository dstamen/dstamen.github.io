      <description>I am honored to have been accepted once again as a Cisco Champion for 2016!
I had a bit of a gap in blog posts this past year due to a job change. However, look forward to more posts on Cisco UCS and maybe even some Cisco ACI.
I am a member of the Cisco Champions Program. Cisco Champions are passionate about Cisco and enjoy sharing our knowledge, expertise, and thoughts across the social web and with Cisco.</description>

      <description>I am honored to have been accepted as a Cisco Champion for 2015! I guess this means I will continue and post to expand contentÂ on Cisco UCS and Cisco IronPort.</description>
