&lt;p&gt;I had a bit of a gap in blog posts this past year due to a job change. However, look forward to more posts on Cisco UCS and maybe even some Cisco ACI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a member of the Cisco Champions Program. Cisco Champions are passionate about Cisco and enjoy sharing our knowledge, expertise, and thoughts across the social web and with Cisco. I am not a representative of Cisco. My views as a Cisco Champion are my own.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Cisco Champion 2015</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2014/11/26/cisco-champion-2015/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2014/11/26/cisco-champion-2015/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I am honored to have been accepted as a Cisco Champion for 2015! I guess this means I will continue and post to expand content on Cisco UCS and Cisco IronPort.&lt;/p&gt;
