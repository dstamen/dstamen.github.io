      <description>So after recently implementing directory sync i wanted to make sure any new groups were properly set up in active directory.
Unfortunately i was unable to find any commands so thanks to MS Support I was able to find a way to identify these. You would think it would be under Get-DistributionGroup but it is actually under Get-MSolGroup. After connecting via remote powershell you can run the below command to see all that are not synced.</description>

      <description>Chrome depreciated one of the features that allowed these popups to work, here is a temporary workaround to get it working.
Download the Chrome Policy Plugin here
 Open the zip file you just downloaded and locate the .ADM file that best matches your system: Extract the .ADM file to any folder on your hard drive Go to Start &amp;gt; Run, and run gpedit.msc Right-click Local Computer Policy &amp;gt; Computer Configuration &amp;gt; Administrative Templates, and select Add/Remove Templates: Add the adm template that you saved to disk earlier: You should now see the template underneath a Google &amp;gt; Google Chrome section within Administrative Templates 2.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know whats going on in the past few weeks but the sheer amount of zeroday exploits via email have risen. To protect yourselves against this I would recommend setting up a transport rule to drop or reject any email with executable content. This can be done for Exchange 2013 or Office365 (Exchange Online).
 Login to Exchange Admin Center using administrative credentials On the left pane select &amp;ldquo;Mail flow&amp;rdquo; On the top pane select &amp;ldquo; Rules&amp;rdquo; Click on the &amp;ldquo;+&amp;rdquo; sign and select create a new rule Give a name to the rule and select &amp;ldquo;more options&amp;rdquo; at the bottom of the page.</description>
