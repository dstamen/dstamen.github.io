      <description>Another New Blog Platform! So it seems there is a bit of battle between the Jekll/Hugo/Ghost platforms. I have been trying to be a little more flexible with Jekyll and it was giving me issues, so I decided to switch to Hugo. After doing the redesign I have been getting feedback that it is much cleaner, so I hope you enjoy it too!
All links should be functional and moved nicely, if they dont work, please leave a comment!</description>
