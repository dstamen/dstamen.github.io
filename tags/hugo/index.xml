So towards the end of the year I kind of slacked on writing some blog posts, when I finally did I realized I had no clue how to create a post. I know&amp;hellip;I know this is terrible, however its still much better than wordpress. I stumbled across an awesome tool that would help you manage your hugo/jekyll website &lt;a href="https://forestry.io"&gt;Forestry.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is quite simple, you login with your Github, Bitbucket, etc account and it can detect your existing repositories. From here, click on Add Site.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Another New Blog Platform</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2017/07/31/another-new-blog-platform/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Jul 2017 16:51:28 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2017/07/31/another-new-blog-platform/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="another-new-blog-platform"&gt;Another New Blog Platform!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it seems there is a bit of battle between the Jekll/Hugo/Ghost platforms. I have been trying to be a little more flexible with Jekyll and it was giving me issues, so I decided to switch to Hugo. After doing the redesign I have been getting feedback that it is much cleaner, so I hope you enjoy it too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All links should be functional and moved nicely, if they dont work, please leave a comment!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
