Over the past two years I had the amazing opportunity to not only present to customers and partners in places I never imagined, but the ability to be an internal subject matter expert and create some amazing content. VMware is an amazing place to work and the relationships I&amp;rsquo;ve made and my impact to the products are beyond things I thought I could ever accomplish. However things must come to an end. The RIF had nothing to do about performance, it was strictly a business decision and many team members across multiple business units were affected. I wish everyone the best of luck, as there are some amazing things coming!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
