With the tools we have available during our hackathon it was asked if we could run vVols in VMware Cloud on AWS. Because of the locked down nature of VMC we could not run vVols directly on that cluster, but I did find a way that we could. Dive into this blog post to see how vVols run on CBS.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Deploying Tanzu Kubernetes Grid (TKG) on VMware Cloud on AWS (VMC)</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/deploying-tkg-on-vmc/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 May 2020 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/deploying-tkg-on-vmc/</guid><description>&lt;p>In a previous post I covered how you can deploy TKG on vSphere, for the second part of our internal hackathon we had a requirement to install TKG on VMware Cloud on AWS (VMC). This post will go over how I was able to get TKG deployed on VMC.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
