      <description>Did you know you could get host your own blog on Ravello Systems?
Its actually quite easy and even easier with Jekyll. Jekyll is a great static content platform perfect for hosting your blog. It is all based on html/css/markdown and requires absolutely no database.
Please use my previous blog on how to get it deployed.
