&lt;p>Unfortunately i was unable to find any commands so thanks to MS Support I was able to find a way to identify these. You would think it would be under Get-DistributionGroup but it is actually under Get-MSolGroup. After connecting via remote powershell you can run the below command to see all that are not synced.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Office 365/Exchange EAC Pop Ups not working with Chrome 37</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2014/10/16/office-365exchange-eac-pop-ups-not-working-with-chrome-37/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2014/10/16/office-365exchange-eac-pop-ups-not-working-with-chrome-37/</guid><description>&lt;p>Chrome depreciated one of the features that allowed these popups to work, here is a temporary workaround to get it working.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Download the Chrome Policy Plugin &lt;a href="http://dl.google.com/dl/edgedl/chrome/policy/policy_templates.zip">here&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Open the zip file you just downloaded and locate the .ADM file that best matches your system:&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Extract the .ADM file to any folder on your hard drive&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Go to Start &amp;gt; Run, and run gpedit.msc&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Right-click Local Computer Policy &amp;gt; Computer Configuration &amp;gt; Administrative Templates, and select Add/Remove Templates:&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add the adm template that you saved to disk earlier:&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You should now see the template underneath a Google &amp;gt; Google Chrome section within Administrative Templates&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>Depending on which operating system you have, it might be under a Classic Administrative Templates (ADM) folder:&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;ol start="6">
&lt;li>Click on Google Chrome in the left-hand pane and then double-click on the item called Enable deprecated web platform features in the list within the right-hand pane:&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>NOTE: It helps to sort the table in the right-hand pane by the Setting column in order to find the Enable deprecated web platform features item more easily.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;ol start="7">
&lt;li>In the new screen that appears, click the Enabled radio button:&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the Options section of the same screen, click the Show… button&lt;/li>
&lt;li>On the new screen that appears, type ShowModalDialog_EffectiveUntil20150430 into the first cell of the table that’s displayed and hit ENTER:
-IMPORTANT NOTE: Make sure there are no spaces either before or after the ShowModalDialog_EffectiveUntil20150430 Otherwise, Chrome will reject the setting (see the Troubleshooting section for more information).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Click OK&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To verify that this policy has taken effect, navigate to the following URL in Chrome: chrome://policy&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If everything is set up correctly, you should see a screen like the following&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

To protect yourselves against this I would recommend setting up a transport rule to drop or reject any email with executable content. This can be done for Exchange 2013 or Office365 (Exchange Online).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
