Every time I would run through a compliance check, they would always report they were up to date even when they were running an older version.
I have recently made a breakthrough working with VMware Support and stumbling through some old blogs. Cisco Support has been terrible on this issue and after repeated attempts to get this case escalated i think the 10th time is a charm.</description></item><item><title>Using UCS PowerTool to Configure Syslog Servers</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2016/03/14/using-ucs-powertool-to-configure-syslog-servers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2016/03/14/using-ucs-powertool-to-configure-syslog-servers/</guid><description>Time for more UCS Scripting!

This allows us to match it quickly without having to dig down into the assigned profile. This script will set the UsrLbl and Name fields on the equipment tab to match the name of the Service Profile.

I had to download some support bundles for every chassis in our multiple zones. Instead of manually going through the GUI, I figured why not script it! This script will connect to each UCS domain and automatically generate a support bundle and download it for each chassis.

Since currently Cisco UCS does not allow selecting multiple VLAN&amp;rsquo;s easily when adding to a VLAN Group or vNIC Template, we now have a pretty decent script that will do it for you.
The script can be found here.

Upon further research, I noticed that &amp;ldquo;Native VLAN&amp;rdquo; was not selected. This is a must for any operating system that does not do VLAN Tagging such as ESXi.
So remember to set the VLAN to Native if using an operating system that does not support VLAN tagging!</description></item></channel></rss>
