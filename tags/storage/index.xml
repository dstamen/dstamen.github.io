      <description>&lt;p&gt;Next up in our Automating your vSphere Upgrade blog series is your VMFS Datastore. vSphere 6.5 and vSphere 6.7 both support the latest VMFS-6. Once all of your ESXi hosts that are connected to the VMFS-5 datastore have been upgraded to vSphere 6.5 or vSphere 6.7 you can then proceed to migrate your datastore to VMFS-6.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Another lovely Friday starting off with strange issues, when taking a host out of standard maintenance we noticed that HA would not reconfigure, and kept saying The object &amp;lsquo;vim.Datastore:datastore-1131&amp;rsquo; has already been deleted or has not been completely created. This was strange because no other hosts had this issue.
I proceeded to follow standard troubleshooting steps, reconfigure HA&amp;hellip;same issue&amp;hellip;.disable HA for entire cluster and re-enable&amp;hellip;..same issue&amp;hellip;whoops thats not good!
First step, check what luns are available to the cluster.</description>

      <description>Currently working on the final steps of getting our new equipment configured. The next step was to configure Syslog on all of our Pure Arrays. Another reason to script this task! Easily populate your arrays and server and at the click of a button you can configure all your arrays easily.
Pre-Requsites  PureStorage Powershell SDK  Link to Script  Set-PureStorageSyslog.ps1  Preparing to Execute the Script The script is pretty straight forward, just need to define a few variables seen below and then you execute the script.</description>

      <description>For the past week, I have been troubleshooting the strangest issue. I have been attempting to move some Windows 8.1 VM&amp;rsquo;s from our legacy datacenter(iSCSI) to our new datacenter(FC).
Whenever I would move the VM to our new DC, it would fail to boot properly. It would boot straight to Windows Recovery. If I moved the same VM to any other type of storage(NFS, iSCSI, Local) the VM would boot perfectly fine.</description>

      <title>Using PowerCLI to Extend VMDK and Windows OS Disk</title>

      <description>I wanted to share this handy script i created when you have a need to extend a disk.
This script can be extremely handy as it will take care of extending the VMDK and then going to the OS and then performing the expansion there as well. This has been helpful when needing to extend a large batch of servers (60+).
Syntax: .\ExtendVMDKandGuest VMNAME
You will then be prompted to enter in the Hard Disk #, the size you want to be extended, and then which drive letter that volume belongs to.</description>

      <description>I thought I would share this script, its been circulating a bit but I feel it is a nice one to have in your toolkit.
Have you ever had to remove a LUN from a cluster and thought &amp;ldquo;Do I really need to detach all the LUN&amp;rsquo;s, before un-mapping from my SAN?&amp;rdquo;
 Unmount Datastore Detach LUN Un-map from SAN Rescan Cluster  Well here is a handy script with output.</description>

      <title>PowerCLI - Extend VMDK and Guest OS</title>

      <description>So as always things change across multiple Window&amp;rsquo;s operating systems and VMware revisions. I had a need to extend the drives on about 50 VMs today and really didn&amp;rsquo;t want to do all that clicking. I remember awhile back it was easy to do this with a Basic Set-Harddisk and use the -ResizeGuestPartition but alas that has been removed from the current functionality. So I took my search to google and found a couple scripts that worked ok, but nothing that was a seamless experience.</description>

      <guid>/2014/05/22/create-vmfs-datastore-using-powercli/</guid>
      <description>For upcoming testing there was a need to create 140 datastores on a cluster for testing. Who wants to do that much clicking and typing? Not me! You can use the below PowerCLI commands to get the SCSI ID&amp;rsquo;s, Create the Datastore and then Rescan all hosts in the cluster.
How do i get the CanonicalName for allocated disks? Get-SCSILun -VMhost 192.168.1.103 -LunType Disk | Select CanonicalName,Capacity  How do I create a VMFS datastore for the CanonicalName I identified above?</description>

      <description>If you are configuring a cluster with less than 2 datastores, you will receive an HA warning &amp;ldquo;The number of heartbeat datastores for host is 1, which is less than required: 2&amp;rdquo; You can add an option to the HA Advanced Options to supress this warning.
 Log in to vCenter Server Right-click the cluster and click Edit Settings Click vSphere HA &amp;gt; Advanced Options Under Option, add an entry for das.</description>

      <title>Get NAA.ID for Virtual Machine RDM&#39;s in VMware</title>

      <guid>/2014/05/06/get-naa-id-for-virtual-machine-rdms-in-vmware/</guid>
      <description>This is a great script to keep handy. If you have multiple RDM&amp;rsquo;s on a VM and need to get the NAA_ID for them the below PowerCLI command will get you that information.
Get-VM VMNAME| Get-HardDisk -DiskType &amp;quot;RawPhysical&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;RawVirtual&amp;quot; | Select Parent,Name,DiskType,ScsiCanonicalName,DeviceName,CapacityGB | fl  If you then need to match the SCSI virtual disk to the Guest OS this is a great article on how to do so.
