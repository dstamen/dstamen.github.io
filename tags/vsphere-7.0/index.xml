Its been a crazy year so far, but glad to be back writing. This issue is one that has been bothering me for some time in my vSphere 7 environment. Every time I logged into the vSphere Client i got the following error. &amp;ldquo;Error downloading plug-in. Make sure that the URL is reachable and the registered thumbprint is correct.&amp;rdquo; I finally had a few moments to research the issue and resolve it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Unable to Sync vLCM Updates - Error: 'integrity.fault.HostPatchInvalidVendorCode'</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/unable-to-sync-vlcm-update-70u1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Oct 2020 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/unable-to-sync-vlcm-update-70u1/</guid><description>&lt;p>After upgrading my vCenter Server to the latest vSphere 7.0 Update 1, I was unable to see ESXi 7.0 Update 1 Image.

I also had multiple code sessions at VMworld 2019 where I got great feedback on the module. It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I have looked at the module, and time has passed so I thought it was due for an update. The module will no longer need to be manually imported, it is now located in the Powershell Gallery!</description></item><item><title>Patching the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) using the REST API - Part 2 (PowerCLI Module)</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2019/01/31/patching-the-vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa-using-the-rest-api-part-2-powershell-module/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2019/01/31/patching-the-vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa-using-the-rest-api-part-2-powershell-module/</guid><description>Previously I covered how to use the VCSA Installer to do a scripted upgrade and then I covered Patching the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) using the REST API - Part 1 (Postman Collection) However, after learning recently how to call API&amp;rsquo;s from Powershell I thought to myself, why not write a Powershell Module for this?
Introduction Using tools such as Postman can make it utilizing API&amp;rsquo;s a bit easier, but you still need to be familiar with a separate tool or UI.</description></item></channel></rss>
