Without the latest Terraform vSphere 1.20.0 Provider, this wouldnt be possible! Lets dive in and take a look on how we can do some appliance deployments.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using PowerCLI to Deploy the Site Recovery Manager 8.3 Appliance</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2020/04/16/using-powercli-to-deploy-the-site-recovery-manager-8.3-appliance/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Apr 2020 08:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2020/04/16/using-powercli-to-deploy-the-site-recovery-manager-8.3-appliance/</guid><description>My latest project was to rebuild one of my labs to run vSphere 7 and Site Recovery Manager 8.3.

Even though UAC was set to &amp;ldquo;Never Notify&amp;rdquo; SRM didnt like this.
To fully disable UAC run the following command from an elevated command prompt and then reboot the system.
REG ADD “HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System” /v EnableLUA /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f Note: You can also avoid this by doing the uninstall as the builtin local administrator account</description></item></channel></rss>
