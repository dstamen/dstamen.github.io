      <description>I was trying to remove SRM 5.1 from our environment and kept getting an error that UAC must be disabled. Even though UAC was set to &amp;ldquo;Never Notify&amp;rdquo; SRM didnt like this.
To fully disable UAC run the following command from an elevated command prompt and then reboot the system.
REG ADD “HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System” /v EnableLUA /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f  Note: You can also avoid this by doing the uninstall as the builtin local administrator account</description>
