This exam was announced with a two week availability in the US priced at $100.
My experience with the exam was actually pretty good. The new interface for the advanced exams is that of an HOL. You are dropped onto the desktop and have a window that slides in and out to pull up the manual and other consoles.
I would definately read up on Josh Andrew&amp;rsquo;s post about what to expect.</description></item></channel></rss>
