      <description>So as everyone has probably seen, vSphere 6.5 is now GA. As usual right away I have upgraded the homelab and have already found a neat new feature.
When you are adding in your VMware licenses, you now have an option to Import License Keys Data&amp;hellip;
To start you need to generate a report from my.vmware.com.
 Log in and Navigate to Download Reports
 Click on the Available Reports dropdown, and select the Product Licenses, Details and History.</description>
