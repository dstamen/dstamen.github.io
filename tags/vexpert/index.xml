      <description>I am honored to have been selected as a VMware vExpert once again for 2017!
This is my fifth year as a vExpert (2013,2014,2015,2016 and 2017). It has been great to see the community grow and the amount of vExperts increase. I did a quick count, and in 2016 we are up to 1464 vExperts!</description>
