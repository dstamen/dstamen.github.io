Here is a quick vagrant runbook that will quickly get a 3 linux servers deployed and installed with KVM to play with.
There are 3 nodes..MGMT01,KVM01 and KVM02. I use MGMT01 VMM to manage KVM01 and KVM02.

Here is a link to the GitHub repository containing all the code.
The code is also fairly simple, it pulls in data from a few .</description></item><item><title>Using Vagrant to Deploy an Ubuntu Server running NGINX</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2015/09/08/using-vagrant-to-deploy-an-ubuntu-server-running-nginx/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2015/09/08/using-vagrant-to-deploy-an-ubuntu-server-running-nginx/</guid><description>So as I was getting around to trying to get a host platform setup for a Jekyll blog I was looking at an alternative to GitHub Pages. I decided I would run it on Ubuntu Server using NGINX as the web platform.
