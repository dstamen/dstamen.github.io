      <description>So as everyone has probably seen, vSphere 6.5 is now GA. One of the features i have been waiting for the most is vCenter HA. I have spent some time trying to get this working in my lab. Unfortunately after countless tries i was stuck.

Every time I would try to configure vCenter HA using the Advanced Wizard, I would get the following error.</description>

I have been working on tons of migrations using Veeam Backup and Replication and need to create re-ip rules to update the static IP assignments.

I was bad at this one, I originally tried and gave up so I did about 20 manually which started to become a huge headache.</description>
