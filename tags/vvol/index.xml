After some troubleshooting it seems there was a regression which no longer makes this available in the UI. Take a look at this blog post on how I will cover a workaround.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Running vVols in VMware Cloud on AWS (VMC) on Pure Storage Cloud Block Store (CBS) on AWS</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/running-vvol-on-vmc-on-cbs/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 May 2020 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/running-vvol-on-vmc-on-cbs/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Another post of a cool project this week. With the tools we have available during our hackathon it was asked if we could run vVols in VMware Cloud on AWS. Because of the locked down nature of VMC we could not run vVols directly on that cluster, but I did find a way that we could. Dive into this blog post to see how vVols run on CBS.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
