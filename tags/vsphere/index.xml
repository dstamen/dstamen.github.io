The answer is yes! With all of the integrations with automation platformsm, Pure Storage Arrays have many options. This blog will cover how to handle this with the VMware Event Broker Appliance (VEBA)!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Unable to Provision a vVol Hard Disk on a VM Located on VMFS Datastore</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2020/06/02/unable-to-provision-a-vvol-hard-disk-on-a-vm-located-on-vmfs-datastore/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jun 2020 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2020/06/02/unable-to-provision-a-vvol-hard-disk-on-a-vm-located-on-vmfs-datastore/</guid><description>&lt;p>An interesting issue came in from one of our customers that they were unable to provision a new vVol Disk on a VM that was based on a VMFS Datastore. After some troubleshooting it seems there was a regression which no longer makes this available in the UI. Take a look at this blog post on how I will cover a workaround.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Considerations for vSphere Component Backup and Restore: Part 2</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2019/10/23/considerations-for-vsphere-component-backup-and-restore-part-2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2019/10/23/considerations-for-vsphere-component-backup-and-restore-part-2/</guid><description>Now that we have covered the considerations to backup each component in your vSphere Environment, it&amp;rsquo;s time to think about the rollback or restore process. In the previous post we discussed how to backup each individual component, in this post we will continue the conversation and discuss considerations to restore or rollback your vSphere Environment components.
Platform Services Controller / vCenter Server When things don&amp;rsquo;t go right with an update, upgrade or configuration change of your Platform Services Controller or vCenter Server you need to understand the proper steps it takes to rollback.</description></item><item><title>Considerations for vSphere Component Backup and Restore: Part 1</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2019/10/21/considerations-for-vsphere-component-backup-and-restore-part-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2019/10/21/considerations-for-vsphere-component-backup-and-restore-part-1/</guid><description>You spend time planning and implementing updates, upgrades and configuration changes to vSphere Environments. Rollback or recovery is usually the last thing on the mind. Did you know there are multiple ways to successfully backup each component in a vSphere Environment? There are also many ways to recover those same components.
In this series we will talk about considerations to backup and restore or rollback your vSphere environment if we have a need to.</description></item><item><title>Patching the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) using the REST API - Part 2 (PowerCLI Module)</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2019/01/31/patching-the-vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa-using-the-rest-api-part-2-powershell-module/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2019/01/31/patching-the-vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa-using-the-rest-api-part-2-powershell-module/</guid><description>Previously I covered how to use the VCSA Installer to do a scripted upgrade and then I covered Patching the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) using the REST API - Part 1 (Postman Collection) However, after learning recently how to call API&amp;rsquo;s from Powershell I thought to myself, why not write a Powershell Module for this?
