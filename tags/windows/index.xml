I have previously showcased VM &amp;amp; CBS deployments with both Powershell and Terraform, but its time to bring it to a new language!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using Bicep to Deploy an Azure Virtual Machine</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2023/05/15/using-bicep-to-deploy-an-azure-virtual-machine/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2023 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2023/05/15/using-bicep-to-deploy-an-azure-virtual-machine/</guid><description>&lt;p>Welcome to another blog on Automation!

Not everyone may use Terraform, but quite a few people are using PowerShell today. Lets take a Look at how we can use AWSPowerShell to deploy an EC2 instance in AWS.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Deploying a Windows Azure VM with Hashicorp Terraform to Microsoft Azure</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/deploy-avm-using-terraform/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Nov 2020 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/deploy-avm-using-terraform/</guid><description>&lt;p>As a followup to my previous post on Automating EC2 deployments, I figured why not show how this can also be done with Microsoft Azure?

After doing this manually a little too often, I figured why not automate it?

Here is that script I thought I would share. Thanksfully there was the NTFSSecurity module published by microsoft that makes permissions a breeze. You can get more details by viewing the module page.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I have also rolled it into a Vagrant package so you can easily test it on your own, and execute the scripts by themselves against your environment to deploy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/dstamen/Vagrant/tree/master/windows-failoverdhcp">Here&lt;/a> is a link to the &lt;strong>GitHub&lt;/strong> repository containing all the code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The code is also fairly simple, it pulls in data from a few .CSV files and deploy&amp;rsquo;s the servers, installs the roles, creates the scopes, creates MAC Address allow policies and then creates a couple reservations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Unable to Install .NET 3.5 on Server 2012R2</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2014/09/11/unable-to-install-net-3-5-on-server-2012r2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2014/09/11/unable-to-install-net-3-5-on-server-2012r2/</guid><description>&lt;p>So upon trying to install .Net 3.5 on a new server today it would not allow me to, it kept telling me the source files were unavailable even after pointing to source directly to multiple ISO&amp;rsquo;s and copied the files locally.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Upon further research I stumbled across this microsoft KB article and used it to ultimately find my fix. &lt;a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2734782%22%3Ehttp://support.microsoft.com/kb/2734782">KB2734782&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
