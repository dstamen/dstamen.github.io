      <description>When the unfortunate reduction in force (RIF) struck in January at VMware, I was in disbelief and didn&amp;rsquo;t even know where to start. Over the past two years I had the amazing opportunity to not only present to customers and partners in places I never imagined, but the ability to be an internal subject matter expert and create some amazing content. VMware is an amazing place to work and the relationships I&amp;rsquo;ve made and my impact to the products are beyond things I thought I could ever accomplish.</description>

      <description>Life can always surprise you. For the past few years I have been chasing the dream like most to work for the “mothership” and recently the calling came.
This month, I will be joining the CPBU at VMware as a Technical Marketing Engineer focused on vSphere upgrades. I will be working alongside Adam Eckerle, Emad Younis, Kyle Ruddy, Mike Foley, Brian Graf, Nigel Hickey and more!
Nigel has it perfect when he titled his announcement “Oh the places you’ll go”.</description>
