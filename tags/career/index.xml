Over the past two years I had the amazing opportunity to not only present to customers and partners in places I never imagined, but the ability to be an internal subject matter expert and create some amazing content. VMware is an amazing place to work and the relationships I&amp;rsquo;ve made and my impact to the products are beyond things I thought I could ever accomplish. However things must come to an end. The RIF had nothing to do about performance, it was strictly a business decision and many team members across multiple business units were affected. I wish everyone the best of luck, as there are some amazing things coming!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>To Infinity and Beyond</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2018/02/06/to-infinity-and-beyond/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Feb 2018 10:34:32 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2018/02/06/to-infinity-and-beyond/</guid><description>&lt;p>Life can always surprise you. For the past few years I have been chasing the dream like most to work for the “mothership” and recently the calling came.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This month, I will be joining the CPBU at VMware as a Technical Marketing Engineer focused on vSphere upgrades. I will be working alongside &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eck79">Adam Eckerle&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/emad_younis">Emad Younis&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kmruddy">Kyle Ruddy&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mikefoley">Mike Foley&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vBrianGraf">Brian Graf&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vCenterNerd">Nigel Hickey&lt;/a> and more!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nigel has it perfect when he titled his announcement &lt;a href="http://nigelhickey.com/oh-places-youll-go/">“Oh the places you’ll go”&lt;/a>. This job will include quite a bit of travel, both domestic and international, and I couldn’t be more excited.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
