      <description>Previously I covered how to use the VCSA Installer to do a scripted upgrade and then I covered Patching the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) using the REST API - Part 1 (Postman Collection) However, after learning recently how to call API&amp;rsquo;s from Powershell I thought to myself, why not write a Powershell Module for this?
Introduction Using tools such as Postman can make it utilizing API&amp;rsquo;s a bit easier, but you still need to be familiar with a separate tool or UI.</description>

      <description>I have been knee deep in migrations, so after clicking through a few times to create clustered file shares, I finally decided to script them. Here is that script I thought I would share. Thanksfully there was the NTFSSecurity module published by microsoft that makes permissions a breeze. You can get more details by viewing the module page.

      <description>Hello! Welcome to my First Veeam PowerShell Script! I have been working on tons of migrations using Veeam Backup and Replication and need to create re-ip rules to update the static IP assignments. Obviously the first rule of scripting if you do something more than once, automate! I was bad at this one, I originally tried and gave up so I did about 20 manually which started to become a huge headache.</description>

      <description>Time for more UCS Scripting! This time to configure Syslog. The script is pretty straightforward, but nice to have to easily set up Syslog across multiple UCS domains.

      <description>In the midst of playing with Ansible and figured my most common use case would be executing powershell scripts on remote servers, so scavenged around and put this together.

      <description>For conformity, we like to set the UCS Equipment labels to match the Service Profile Name. This allows us to match it quickly without having to dig down into the assigned profile. This script will set the UsrLbl and Name fields on the equipment tab to match the name of the Service Profile.

      <description>Automation, Automation, Automation! I had to download some support bundles for every chassis in our multiple zones. Instead of manually going through the GUI, I figured why not script it! This script will connect to each UCS domain and automatically generate a support bundle and download it for each chassis.

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s patch time! That means time to upload the firmware bundles to all my UCS domains. Instead of doing it manually I figured i would create a quick script to do that for me.

      <description>Im finally getting to dive back in to working with UCS. My latest task with my project of configuring 9 UCS Domains, was configuring the Policy Backup and Export. See below on how to automate this process!

      <description>Im finally getting to dive back in to working with UCS. My latest task with my project of configuring 9 UCS Domains, was swapping out certificates. The first few I did via the GUI, and I thought can this be scripted? Well the answer is yes! See below for information on executing the script.
