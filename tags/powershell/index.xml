The answer is yes! With all of the integrations with automation platformsm, Pure Storage Arrays have many options. This blog will cover how to handle this with the VMware Event Broker Appliance (VEBA)!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Updating the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) with PowerCLI - Revisited</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2020/06/22/updating-the-vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa-with-powercli-revisited/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2020/06/22/updating-the-vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa-with-powercli-revisited/</guid><description>In previous blogs, I covered how to update your VCSA using PowerCLI and with Postman. I also had multiple code sessions at VMworld 2019 where I got great feedback on the module. It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I have looked at the module, and time has passed so I thought it was due for an update. The module will no longer need to be manually imported, it is now located in the Powershell Gallery!</description></item><item><title>Installing and Updating the Pure Storage vSphere Plugin</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2020/03/03/installing-and-updating-the-pure-storage-vsphere-plugin/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2020/03/03/installing-and-updating-the-pure-storage-vsphere-plugin/</guid><description>&lt;p>Welcome to the first of many Pure Storage blogs. As I get ramped up with the latest information I plan to do a series of getting started with Pure Storage features. These blogs will cover things such as the vSphere Client (HTML5) Plugin, FlashArray, FlashBlade and integrations with other VMware products. First up is learning to install and update the Pure Storage vSphere Client Plugin.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Patching the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) using the REST API - Part 2 (PowerCLI Module)</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2019/01/31/patching-the-vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa-using-the-rest-api-part-2-powershell-module/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2019/01/31/patching-the-vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa-using-the-rest-api-part-2-powershell-module/</guid><description>Previously I covered how to use the VCSA Installer to do a scripted upgrade and then I covered Patching the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) using the REST API - Part 1 (Postman Collection) However, after learning recently how to call API&amp;rsquo;s from Powershell I thought to myself, why not write a Powershell Module for this?
Introduction Using tools such as Postman can make it utilizing API&amp;rsquo;s a bit easier, but you still need to be familiar with a separate tool or UI.</description></item><item><title>Using Powershell to Create Windows SMB Shares</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2016/08/09/using-powershell-to-create-windows-smb-shares/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2016/08/09/using-powershell-to-create-windows-smb-shares/</guid><description>I have been knee deep in migrations, so after clicking through a few times to create clustered file shares, I finally decided to script them. Here is that script I thought I would share. Thanksfully there was the NTFSSecurity module published by microsoft that makes permissions a breeze. You can get more details by viewing the module page.

Welcome to my First Veeam PowerShell Script! I have been working on tons of migrations using Veeam Backup and Replication and need to create re-ip rules to update the static IP assignments. Obviously the first rule of scripting if you do something more than once, automate! I was bad at this one, I originally tried and gave up so I did about 20 manually which started to become a huge headache.</description></item><item><title>Using PureStorage Powershell to Configure SysLog Servers</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2016/03/14/using-purestorage-powershell-to-configure-syslog-servers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2016/03/14/using-purestorage-powershell-to-configure-syslog-servers/</guid><description>Currently working on the final steps of getting our new equipment configured. The next step was to configure Syslog on all of our Pure Arrays. Another reason to script this task! Easily populate your arrays and server and at the click of a button you can configure all your arrays easily.
