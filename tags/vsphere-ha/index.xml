This was strange because no other hosts had this issue. I proceeded to follow standard troubleshooting steps, reconfigure HA&amp;hellip;same issue&amp;hellip;.disable HA for entire cluster and re-enable&amp;hellip;..same issue&amp;hellip;whoops thats not good!
First step, check what luns are available to the cluster.</description></item><item><title>HA Error: Datastore Heartbeat is less than 2</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2014/05/08/ha-error-datastore-heartbeat-is-less-than-2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2014/05/08/ha-error-datastore-heartbeat-is-less-than-2/</guid><description>If you are configuring a cluster with less than 2 datastores, you will receive an HA warning &amp;ldquo;The number of heartbeat datastores for host is 1, which is less than required: 2&amp;rdquo; You can add an option to the HA Advanced Options to supress this warning.
