It is also a great place to use your analytic&amp;rsquo;s data to your advantage and use it for intelligent VMware provisioning! In this blog post I will cover how to use this data to your advantage to make sure you can easily deploy VM&amp;rsquo;s to the most optimal array and datastore.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Unable to Provision a vVol Hard Disk on a VM Located on VMFS Datastore</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2020/06/02/unable-to-provision-a-vvol-hard-disk-on-a-vm-located-on-vmfs-datastore/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jun 2020 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2020/06/02/unable-to-provision-a-vvol-hard-disk-on-a-vm-located-on-vmfs-datastore/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;An interesting issue came in from one of our customers that they were unable to provision a new vVol Disk on a VM that was based on a VMFS Datastore.
