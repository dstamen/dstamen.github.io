      <description>Chrome depreciated one of the features that allowed these popups to work, here is a temporary workaround to get it working.
Download the Chrome Policy Plugin here
 Open the zip file you just downloaded and locate the .ADM file that best matches your system: Extract the .ADM file to any folder on your hard drive Go to Start &amp;gt; Run, and run gpedit.msc Right-click Local Computer Policy &amp;gt; Computer Configuration &amp;gt; Administrative Templates, and select Add/Remove Templates: Add the adm template that you saved to disk earlier:   You should now see the template underneath a Google &amp;gt; Google Chrome section within Administrative Templates  Depending on which operating system you have, it might be under a Classic Administrative Templates (ADM) folder:    Click on Google Chrome in the left-hand pane and then double-click on the item called Enable deprecated web platform features in the list within the right-hand pane:   NOTE: It helps to sort the table in the right-hand pane by the Setting column in order to find the Enable deprecated web platform features item more easily.</description>
