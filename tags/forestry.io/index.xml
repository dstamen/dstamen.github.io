So towards the end of the year I kind of slacked on writing some blog posts, when I finally did I realized I had no clue how to create a post. I know&amp;hellip;I know this is terrible, however its still much better than wordpress. I stumbled across an awesome tool that would help you manage your hugo/jekyll website &lt;a href="https://forestry.io">Forestry.io&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is quite simple, you login with your Github, Bitbucket, etc account and it can detect your existing repositories. From here, click on Add Site.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
