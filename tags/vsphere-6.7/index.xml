I also had multiple code sessions at &lt;a href="https://videos.vmworld.com/global/2019?q=CODE1817UR"&gt;VMworld 2019&lt;/a&gt; where I got great feedback on the module. It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I have looked at the module, and time has passed so I thought it was due for an update. The module will no longer need to be manually imported, it is now located in the &lt;a href="https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/VMware.Community.VCSA.Update"&gt;Powershell Gallery!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Windows Server 2008 is Going EOL - What about my vCenter Server?</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2019/08/12/windows-server-2008-is-going-eol-what-about-my-vcenter-server/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2019/08/12/windows-server-2008-is-going-eol-what-about-my-vcenter-server/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Windows Server 2008 and 2008 R2 will be end-of-life on January 14th, 2020.

If you have used 6.7 GA you may have noticed the Auto Deploy functionality did not yet make it into the long awaited vSphere Client. With vCenter Server 6.7 U1 we now have feature parity and this means Auto Deploy has been added to the vSphere Client. Lets jump in and see some of the new functionality that has been included.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Why and How To Upgrade to vSphere 6.7 U1</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2018/10/11/why-and-how-to-upgrade-to-vsphere-6.7-u1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2018/10/11/why-and-how-to-upgrade-to-vsphere-6.7-u1/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;vSphere 6.7 Update 1 is finally here!

In our workshops one of the common things I hear is that most folks aren&amp;rsquo;t using the CLI based tools that have been included in the installer. I am a huge fan of these as they make migrations and upgrades seamless&amp;ndash;especially when having to perform the task if you have multiple PSC&amp;rsquo;s and vCenter Servers. Using the CLI tools don’t have to be intimidating, as we go through this blog we will cover some how-to&amp;rsquo;s and benefits of using the CLI based approach.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Patching your vCenter Server Appliance from 6.7 to 6.7a</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2018/05/23/patching-your-vcenter-server-appliance-from-6.7-to-6.7a/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 May 2018 12:45:07 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2018/05/23/patching-your-vcenter-server-appliance-from-6.7-to-6.7a/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;On May 22nd we released the first update to our vCenter Server 6.7 version, 6.7a.

I&amp;rsquo;ve been using 6.7 through the &lt;a href="https://secure.vmware.com/43478_vSphere_Beta_Reg"&gt;vSphere Beta Program&lt;/a&gt; and testing even newer features in my current role. I am here to talk to you about planning your vSphere upgrade and some planning and considerations you should have when going to the latest release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first, thing I would like to mention is there is no supported migration from vSphere 5.x to 6.7. You must be running vSphere 6.0 or 6.5.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
