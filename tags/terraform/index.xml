After doing this manually a little too often, I figured why not automate it?

In this blog I will cover how to use Terraform to provision your Pure Storage Infrastructure. This will be the first post of many that show how easy it is to accomplish the same task using multiple automation methods.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using Terraform to Deploy the Pure1 VM Analytics Collector</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2020/06/30/using-terraform-to-deploy-the-pure1-vm-analytics-collector/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 07:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2020/06/30/using-terraform-to-deploy-the-pure1-vm-analytics-collector/</guid><description>&lt;p>Pure1 VM Analytics is a great tool to have in your environment. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to even have a Pure Storage array, but it makes it even better! Back in 2019 the collector was converted to an OVA format and has been much simpler to deploy. You can deploy it through the UI or even Powershell. With the latest update to the Terraform vSphere provider we can now deploy OVA&amp;rsquo;s, so lets jump in to see how we can deploy the VM Analytics collector!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using Terraform to Deploy the VMware Event Broker Appliance</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2020/06/29/using-terraform-to-deploy-the-vmware-event-broker-appliance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jun 2020 08:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2020/06/29/using-terraform-to-deploy-the-vmware-event-broker-appliance/</guid><description>&lt;p>With the addition of OVF/OVA customized properties in Terraform, I figured I would put together a few runbooks for appliances to deploy.

Without the latest Terraform vSphere 1.20.0 Provider, this wouldnt be possible! Lets dive in and take a look on how we can do some appliance deployments.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
