      <description>With all this talk about VMware vs KVM I figured that I would attempt to load a base install of KVM to see what it was all about.
Here is a quick vagrant runbook that will quickly get a 3 linux servers deployed and installed with KVM to play with.
There are 3 nodes..MGMT01,KVM01 and KVM02. I use MGMT01 VMM to manage KVM01 and KVM02.

      <description>So as I was getting around to trying to get a host platform setup for a Jekyll blog I was looking at an alternative to GitHub Pages. I decided I would run it on Ubuntu Server using NGINX as the web platform.
Here is a quick vagrant runbook that will quickly get a linux server deployed and install NGINX to host your website.
The code can be found here.
