I am currently troubleshooting some issues with DVS uplinks no longer being assigned on reboot.
As a heads up. If you are doing this on ESXi 6.0.. don&amp;rsquo;t. It can cause an issue with the proxy DVS having different ID than the actual DVS causing my original issue, still working with VMware Support to find out more details.
After &amp;ldquo;Restoring Network Configuration&amp;rdquo; a few too many times, I finally realized I could just add the uplinks back via CLI until support can figure out why this is occurring, here are the details on how to manage the uplinks on a DVS via CLI.</description></item></channel></rss>
