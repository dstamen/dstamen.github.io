      <description>So currently Cisco has an issue with installing their ENIC and FNIC VIBs through Update Manager for ESXi 6.x. Until that is resolved I need to manually push out patches to these hosts. Obviously I do not want to do this manually, so I will be utilizing PowerCLI to accomplish this task.
Pre-Requsites   VMware PowerCLI  Link to Script   Install-HostVIB.ps1  Preparing to Execute the Script The script is pretty straight forward, just need to define a few variables seen below and then you execute the script.</description>

      <description>Normally when i need to install and update a host VIB I use Update Manager. However there is currently a bug with Cisco&amp;rsquo;s latest enic/fnic drivers that wont let you install them via UM.
I had to run these updates on over 50 hosts and I really didn&amp;rsquo;t want to have to ssh and install it manually. Lucky I remember Brian Graf&amp;amp;rsquo;s Host Client Install Fling and borrowed some of the code to come up with the below script.</description>
