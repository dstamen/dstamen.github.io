While the traditional EC2 boot process is dependable, it relies on local EBS storage. In this guide, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to leverage Pure Cloud Block Store to overcome this limitation by using an iPXE-based AMI. This method enables you to bootstrap EC2 instances over iSCSI, allowing for fully stateless deployments.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using CloudFormation to Manage EC2 in AWS</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2023/03/30/using-cloudformation-to-manage-ec2-in-aws/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Mar 2023 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2023/03/30/using-cloudformation-to-manage-ec2-in-aws/</guid><description>&lt;p>An update to a topic I previously covered! How can we automate management of virtual machines in AWS? Cloud Formation (CFT) is another way that can accomplish it. This blog will identify how you can create, update and delete a CFT stack to be able to manage your EC2 infrastructure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Deploying a Linux EC2 Instance with Hashicorp Terraform and Vault to AWS and Connect to Pure Cloud Block Store</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/deploy-linux-ec2-using-terraform-vault/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Nov 2020 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/deploy-linux-ec2-using-terraform-vault/</guid><description>&lt;p>Another update to my &amp;ldquo;Terraforming AWS&amp;rdquo; series is the ability to deploy a Linux based Instance and connect to an existing data volume sitting on the Pure Cloud Block Store.

Not everyone may use Terraform, but quite a few people are using PowerShell today. Lets take a Look at how we can use AWSPowerShell to deploy an EC2 instance in AWS.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Deploying a Windows EC2 Instance with Hashicorp Terraform and Vault to AWS</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/deploy-ec2-using-terraform-vault/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Nov 2020 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/deploy-ec2-using-terraform-vault/</guid><description>&lt;p>As part of demonstrating our products to customers, I tend to reprovision EC2 instances to show how easy it is to mount data in AWS to Cloud Block Store. After doing this manually a little too often, I figured why not automate it? Check out this blog on how I use Terraform to deploy a EC2 instance and configure it for in-guest iSCSI.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
