      <description>&lt;p&gt;Previously I covered how to use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2018/09/upgrading-platform-services-controller-and-vcenter-server-via-the-cli-installer.html&#34;&gt;VCSA Installer to do a scripted upgrade&lt;/a&gt; and then I covered &lt;a href=&#34;https://davidstamen.com/2018/12/20/patching-the-vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa-using-the-rest-api/&#34;&gt;Patching the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) using the REST API - Part 1 (Postman Collection)&lt;/a&gt; However, after learning recently how to call API&amp;rsquo;s from Powershell I thought to myself, why not write a Powershell Module for this?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a huge fan of Automating the vSphere Lifecycle process. The next step I wanted to cover was patching the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) using the REST API.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Upgrading Platform Services Controller and vCenter Server via the CLI Installer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first topic we will cover in our Automating your vSphere Upgrade series is updating our core infrastructure. Upgrading Platform Services Controller(PSC)  and vCenter Server via the CLI installer. In our workshops one of the common things I hear is that most folks aren&amp;rsquo;t using the CLI based tools that have been included in the installer. I am a huge fan of these as they make migrations and upgrades seamless&amp;ndash;especially when having to perform the task if you have multiple PSC&amp;rsquo;s and vCenter Servers. Using the CLI tools don’t have to be intimidating, as we go through this blog we will cover some how-to&amp;rsquo;s and benefits of using the CLI based approach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s finally out! vSphere 6.7 is the next major release of VMware&amp;rsquo;s virtualization software. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using 6.7 through the &lt;a href=&#34;https://secure.vmware.com/43478_vSphere_Beta_Reg&#34;&gt;vSphere Beta Program&lt;/a&gt; and testing even newer features in my current role. I am here to talk to you about planning your vSphere upgrade and some planning and considerations you should have when going to the latest release.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Another lovely Friday starting off with strange issues, when taking a host out of standard maintenance we noticed that HA would not reconfigure, and kept saying The object &amp;lsquo;vim.Datastore:datastore-1131&amp;rsquo; has already been deleted or has not been completely created. This was strange because no other hosts had this issue.
I proceeded to follow standard troubleshooting steps, reconfigure HA&amp;hellip;same issue&amp;hellip;.disable HA for entire cluster and re-enable&amp;hellip;..same issue&amp;hellip;whoops thats not good!
First step, check what luns are available to the cluster.</description>

      <description>vSphere 6.5U1 was released on July 27th. This is an incremental update a lot of people wait for before upgrading from a previous version. I have been lucky to have been running on vSphere 6.5 for quite some time and have been enjoying it very much.
Obviously we never upgrade production first, if we can help it. I decided to attempt an upgrade on one of our QA vCenters that was deployed using the VCHA Advanced workflow.</description>

      <title>Using PowerCLI to Set vCenter Permissions on Datacenter</title>

      <description>I have been working on doing a vCenter Consolidation Project. This has meant recreating multiple permissions groups. I couldnt find an easy way to apply permissions at a datacenter so I updated this script to be used.
Pre-Requsites  VMware PowerCLI  Link to Script  Set-vCenterPermissions.ps1 permissions.csv  Preparing to Execute the Script The script is pretty straight forward, just need to update columns in the CSV such as Datacenter, Group and Role.</description>

      <title>vSphere 6.5 - Updating Appliance configured with vCenter HA</title>
      <link>/2017/02/03/vsphere-65-updating-appliance-configured-with-vcenter-ha/</link>

      <description>Warning: A few others and myself have noticed that when updating a VCHA Cluster to 6.5U1 it resets the hostname to localhost.localdomain stopping vCenter Web Client from Loading. It seems to be isolated to Advanced Deployments and not Basic. I would recommend destroying your VCHA Cluster, updating, then redeploying in this scenario. Warning2: It also seems that if you try to redeploy VCHA Advanced after an upgrade, it still resets the hostname, I have a case opened and will update here as neccessary.</description>

      <title>Using PowerCLI to Build Out vCenter</title>
      <link>/2015/10/08/using-powercli-to-build-out-vcenter/</link>

      <guid>/2015/10/08/using-powercli-to-build-out-vcenter/</guid>
      <description>I wanted to share this handy script i created when you have a need to build out a new vCenter.
This script can be extremely handy as it will take care of creating the datacenter, cluster, adding hosts, creating datastores and then applying the appropriate host profile. It is all done via CSV files so it is extremely customizable.
Files to modify to customize your configuration  createdatacenter.csv - Contains the name of the datacenter to create.</description>
