In the previous post we discussed how to backup each individual component, in this post we will continue the conversation and discuss considerations to restore or rollback your vSphere Environment components.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="platform-services-controller--vcenter-server">Platform Services Controller / vCenter Server&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When things don&amp;rsquo;t go right with an update, upgrade or configuration change of your Platform Services Controller or vCenter Server you need to understand the proper steps it takes to rollback. In these scenarios sometimes there may have been a failure in the process, or after a successful upgrade was completed, an incompatibility was found which would result in a rollback. A reason we see the need to rollback a vCenter Server is when a supporting solution such as a backup vendor or monitoring vendor is not compatible. In this case you will need to revert to the previous version.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Considerations for vSphere Component Backup and Restore: Part 1</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2019/10/21/considerations-for-vsphere-component-backup-and-restore-part-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2019/10/21/considerations-for-vsphere-component-backup-and-restore-part-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>You spend time planning and implementing updates, upgrades and configuration changes to vSphere Environments.

&lt;h2 id="vcenter-ha-overview">vCenter HA Overview&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>vCenter HA has seen wide adoption as customers wish to provide provide high availability for their vCenter Server. VMware Solutions such as Site Recovery Manager, NSX and Horizon View rely heavily on the availability of the vCenter Server being online, so having a low RPO and RTO assists in availability of these business critical applications. vCenter Server 6.7 Update 1 introduced workflow improvements by bringing vCenter HA into the vSphere Client. There are no longer two separate Basic and Advanced workflows. If the vCenter Server is self-managed the passive and witness nodes will be automatically deployed. However, if the vCenter Server is not self-managed the workflow will prompt you for the managing vCenter Servers credential.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>vCenter Server Converge Tool - What About My Certificates</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2019/06/07/vcenter-server-converge-tool-what-about-my-certificates/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2019/06/07/vcenter-server-converge-tool-what-about-my-certificates/</guid><description>&lt;p>As more customers get ready to run the vCenter Server Converge Tool in their environments, a common question that has been asked is &amp;ldquo;What Happens to my Certificates?&amp;rdquo; Well that is a good question so lets find out!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>vCenter Server Appliance CLI - JSON Creator</title><link>https://davidstamen.com/2019/04/24/vcenter-server-appliance-cli-json-creator/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidstamen.com/2019/04/24/vcenter-server-appliance-cli-json-creator/</guid><description>&lt;p>I am proud to announce that my first VMware Clarity Project the VCSA JSON Creator is now live!

I was able to develop my own version and build my first Powershell Module that you can use to patch the VCSA in a simple method. Some of the function names below may not be 100% exact and this is due to the accepted verbs for Powershell.

I am a huge fan of these as they make migrations and upgrades seamless&amp;ndash;especially when having to perform the task if you have multiple PSC&amp;rsquo;s and vCenter Servers.
